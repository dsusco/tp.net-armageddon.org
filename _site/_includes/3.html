  {% h1 War Engines %}

  <blockquote>
    <p>How much like a god he is, that ancient machine, primal of all his kind! His mighty fists, massive like two towers of destruction, laden with the doom of mankind’s bitter foes. He watches over us now as battle joins, and in his shadow we shall advance upon our enemies and defeat them.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The battlefields of the 41<sup>st</sup> Millennium are home to some awesomely large vehicles, many of which tower high above the battlefield and carry weapons batteries of terrifying potency. Most famous of all of these are the Titans created by the Adeptus Mechanicus of the Imperium, but there are many others including the Gargants fielded by Ork armies and the living bio-Titans fielded by the Tyranids. All of these creations are referred to as <em>war engines</em> in the Epic rules.</p>

  <p>War engines include all very large machines, such as Ork Gargants, Imperial Titans, Imperial Guard Baneblades and Space Marine Thunderhawk Gunships. Because of their huge size and awesome toughness, war engines are very different to other units, and because of this many of the core game rules are modified when it comes to war engines.</p>

  <p>That said, the main difference between a war engine and a normal vehicle is that the war engine has a <em>damage capacity</em> (abbreviated <abbr title="Damage Capacity">DC</abbr>) that shows how many <q>kills</q> the war engine can absorb before it is destroyed. For example, a Warlord Titan has a <abbr title="Damage Capacity">DC</abbr> of 8, and it therefore takes eight <q>kills</q> to destroy it. For most rules purposes, a war engine counts as being <q>worth</q> a number of units equal to its starting damage capacity, so a war engine’s starting damage capacity is also used to work out how many dice it rolls in an assault, how easy it is to pin and so on. This and all of the other modifications to the core game rules are described in detail as follows.</p>

  {% h2 War Engine Movement %}

  <p>War engines follow the same movement rules as any other unit. War engines that fail a dangerous terrain test suffer a hit (see the damage rules below).</p>

  {% h3 War Engine Formations %}

  <p>War engines are so large they usually operate as single units. Although only one unit, the war engine is still a separate formation, and all of the rules that apply to formations apply to it also.</p>

  <p>Some smaller war engines like Baneblades operate in formations of more than one unit. War engines count as being within formation coherency distance if they are within a distance equal to their starting damage capacity × 5cm of another unit from the formation. For example, a Bandeblade has a starting damage capacity of 3, and so will be in formation as long as it is within (3×5) = 15cm of another unit.</p>

  {% h3 War Engine Zones Of Control %}

  <p>War engines have a zone of control like any other unit. In an assault they only lose their zone of control once they have been charged by a number of units equal to their starting damage capacity.</p>

  {% h3 Transport War Engines %}

  <p>War Engines Some war engines are capable of transporting other units. These war engines are an exception to the rule that transport vehicles may only carry units from their own formation. Instead a war engine transport vehicle can carry units from another formation, as long as the entire formation can fit inside the war engine, and as long as the entire formation mounts up as part of the same move. Note that a war engine may carry other units from its own formation using the normal rules (see <a href="#transport-vehicles">Transport Vehicles</a>).</p>

  <p>For a formation to mount up in this way the units that are getting on board must be able to move into base contact with the war engine during their action. The war engine is allowed to have taken an action before the other formation mounts up, but may not take an action after they have done so. While being transported the units may not shoot or carry out any other actions except to rally in the end phase (see <a href="#rallying-formations">Rallying Formations</a>).</p>

  <p>Once the units being transported have mounted up, the war engine can move off with them inside as part of one of its own actions in a subsequent turn. It can dismount the transported units at the end of a move in the same way as a normal transport vehicle (i.e., the units are placed within 5cms of the transport at the end of a move).</p>

  <p>Formations that dismount in this way may not take an action in the turn they dismount, but are allowed to either shoot or fight in an assault if the war engine that was transporting it is able to shoot or assault. In both cases, the war engine and the transported units are treated as a single formation until the shooting attack or assault has been resolved. The war engine and the formation that disembarked are treated as being separate formations once the war engine has completely resolved its action.</p>

  <p>For example, a war engine could take a double action and disembark any troops it was carrying at the end of its move. The war engine and the disembarked units could then shoot together at a target formation, but all shooting would suffer the -1 modifier for shooting while taking a double action. Alternatively a war engine could take an engage action and dismount any transported units at the end of its charge move. It and the disembarking units would be treated as a single formation for the purposes of resolving the assault, as if they were making a combined assault (see <a href="#commanders"><em>Commanders</em></a>, paragraph 3).</p>

  {% h2 War Engine Shooting %}

  <p>The following special rules apply when shooting either at or with war engines. In general, war engines are treated in the same manner as armoured vehicle targets (i.e., any hit that would affect an armoured vehicle can affect a war engine). Any exceptions to this are noted below.</p>

  {% h3 Allocating Hits To War Engines %}

  <p>Normally, you may only allocate one hit to a unit in a formation until all units in the formation have been allocated one hit each. This doesn’t apply to war engines. Instead, the defender allocates a number of hits equal to the war engine’s starting damage capacity before he allocates any hits to other units.</p>

  <p>If a formation includes both war engines and non-war engine units then an attacker must state whether any attacks he makes on the formation will be directed at the war engines or the other units in the formation. Attacks directed at the war engines can only be allocated against war engines if they hit, while attacks directed at other units may not be allocated to the war engines in the formation.</p>

  <p>Special rules apply to war engines that are attacked by weapons that use templates (see <a href="#barrages">Barrages</a>). Normally these weapons attack each unit that falls under the template once each. However, due to its huge size if a war engine lies directly under the centre of a template, then it is subjected to a number of attacks equal to half its starting damage capacity, rounding fractions up. For example, a Baneblade (<abbr title="Damage Capacity">DC</abbr>3) caught under the centre of a template would be attacked twice. You may wish to make sure that your barrage templates have a small hole in the centre so that you can see if a war engine suffers the full effect of the bombardment or is only attacked once.</p>

  {% h3 War Engine Damage Capacity %}

  <p>Unlike normal vehicles, war engines are able to absorb more than one hit before they are destroyed. The number of hits a war engine can take is shown by its damage capacity. Each hit that is not saved will reduce the war engine’s damage capacity by 1 point, and the war engine is only destroyed once its damage capacity is reduced to 0. Place one Blast marker on the war engine’s formation for each point of damage that it suffers.</p>

  {% h3 Critical Hits %}

  <p>The weapons used in Epic are so destructive that they have the ability to destroy or damage even the largest target if they hit the right place. To represent this, any hit on a war engine (no matter how it was inflicted) has a chance of causing critical damage. Roll a D6 for each hit scored on a war engine. On a roll of 1–5 the target suffers normal damage and its damage capacity is reduced by 1 point. On a roll of a 6 the hit has caused critical damage; the war engine still loses one point of damage capacity, but in addition suffers a critical hit.</p>

  <p>The effect of a critical hit is listed on the war engine’s datasheet and will vary from one type of war engine to another. For example, Imperial Titans are vulnerable to hits on their dangerously unstable plasma reactors, while Ork Gargants are renowned for catching fire, and so on.</p>

  <p>If a war engine suffers more than one critical hit then the effects of all of the hits are cumulative.</p>

  {% h3 Blast Markers %}

  <p>Every time a war engine loses a point of damage then the formation it is part of receives one Blast marker. If a war engine is destroyed by the effect of a critical hit then the formation it belongs to receives a number of extra Blast markers equal to the damage capacity the war engine would have had remaining were it not destroyed. For example, if a previously undamaged Baneblade in a Super Heavy Tank Company were destroyed by a single critical hit then the company would receive three Blast markers.</p>

  <p>It requires a number of Blast markers equal to a war engine’s starting damage capacity to suppress or break a war engine. Add the starting damage capacity of any functioning war engines in a formation together in order to find out how many Blast markers are required to break the formation. If the formation includes units that are not war engines, then add the starting damage capacity of any functioning war engines in the formation to the number of other non-war engine units to find the formation’s break point. For example, an Ork formation with a Battlefortress (<abbr title="Damage Capacity">DC</abbr>3) and six Boyz would be broken by 3+6 = 9 Blast markers. War engines rally using the normal rules.</p>

  <p>A broken war engine is assumed to have a number of Blast markers equal to its starting damage capacity for all rules purposes. If there are any enemy units within 15cms of the war engine after it makes a withdrawal then it suffers one extra point of damage (no save allowed) for each enemy unit that is within 15cms. Additional hits caused by losing an assault or receiving Blast markers while broken cause one point of damage each. Roll for critical hits from these extra hits as you would normally.</p>

  {% h3 Titan Killer Weapons %}

  <p>Some units are armed with weapons that are noted as being Titan Killers (see <a href="#titan-killers"><em>Titan Killers</em></a>). Many of these weapons are capable of taking down a war engine with a single shot. Enemy units hit by such weapons may not take a cover or armour save, even if they have reinforced armour. Note that cover to hit modifiers do apply.</p>

  <p>In addition, Titan Killer weapons will usually have a dice roll noted in brackets on their data sheet. For example, the Volcano Cannon mounted on an Imperial Guard Shadowsword is noted as being a Titan Killer (D3) weapon. If such a weapon hits a war engine then the war engine suffers damage equal to the roll of the appropriate sort of dice. Each point of damage will reduce the war engine’s damage capacity by 1 point. Roll for critical hits for each point of damage inflicted. Titan Killer weapons that do not have a dice roll in brackets only inflict one point of damage.</p>

  <p>When allocating Titan killer hits that may cause multiple points of damage, roll for damage immediately after allocating the hit. The War Engine counts as having been allocated a number of hits equal to the damage rolled. This is solely for purposes of allocation. Damage is applied as normal, only after all hits have been allocated.</p>

  <aside class="example-of-play">
    <header>Titan Killer Weapons</header>

    <p>A formation of Shadowswords scores 3 Titan Killer (D3) hits against a pair of Warhounds. The first hit is allocated and the roll for damage is 2. The first Warhound counts as having 2 hits allocated to it. Because it has 3 Damage Capacity, the front Warhound can still be allocated an additional hit. The second Titan Killer hit is therefore applied to the front Warhound. The die is again a 2. Multiple Titan Killer hits don’t <q>spill over</q> to other units in the formation, so the lead Warhound will take all 4 hits. As the number of hits allocated exceeds the Damage Capacity of the lead Warhound, the final Titan Killer hit will be allocated to the second Warhound. Note that even if the lead Warhound had been damaged and the 2 points of Titan Killer damage from the first shot would be enough to destroy it, damage is only applied after allocation. The Warhound would remain in play until all hits were allocated exactly as above. Once allocation was complete, the damage would be applied and the Warhound removed.</p>
  </aside>

  {% h2 War Engine Assaults %}

  <p>War engines can be devastating in an assault, which is reflected by the following special rules.</p>

  {% h3 Charge Moves %}

  <p>When a war engine charges it is allowed to <q>barge</q> any non-war engine units belonging to the target formation out of the way and carry on with its charge move. Move the war engine as far as desired, and then place any units that were barged out of the way as close as you can to their starting point, while still touching the base of the war engine that so rudely pushed them aside. The maximum number of units a war engine can barge aside in this manner is two per point of its starting damage capacity. Note that war engines may not barge other war engines out of the way.</p>

  <p>The rule that no more than two units may move into base contact with an enemy unit when they charge does not apply to war engines. Instead a war engine may be charged by up to two enemy units per point of its’ starting damage capacity (i.e., a Baneblade with a <abbr title="Damage Capacity">DC</abbr> of 3 could be contacted by up to six enemy units).</p>

  {% h3 Close Combat and Firefight Attacks %}

  <p>Instead of rolling a single hit dice for each war engine in an assault, roll a number of hit dice equal to the war engine’s starting damage capacity. You may choose to split these between close combat rolls and firefight rolls as you see fit, but close combat rolls will only hit enemy units in base contact, while firefight rolls will only hit units within 15cm that are not in base contact.</p>

  {% h3 Result Rolls %}

  <p>When working out the result of an assault that includes a war engine, count each point of damage inflicted on a war engine as a <q>casualty</q>. Each surviving war engine counts as a number of units equal to its starting damage capacity when working out if one side outnumbers the other. If a war engine loses an assault, then it takes one extra point of damage for each point it lost the assault by. Roll for critical hits normally.</p>

  {% h2 War Engine Training Scenario %}

  <blockquote>
    <p>We’ve got our Gargantz an’ we’ve got our weapons. Wot ain't we got? We ain’t got anyfing for target practice iz wot! So I'll tell you wot we're gonna do. We’re gonna give da Humies a taste of ’ot metal death is wot. We’s gonna take Big Gork and Big Mork ’ere an’ we’s gonna stomp Hummie!</p>

    <footer class="text-right"><cite>Warlord Dragnatz prepares the Boyz for the Waaargh!</cite></footer>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The following training scenario will allow you to quickly and easily try out war engines for the first time. We highly recommend playing the scenario before including war engines in any normal games, as so many special rules apply to war engines that including them in a full sized game without any practice will slow things down to a crawl.</p>

  <p>If you play Korps Grinda Returns twice, once as each side, then you will gain a good grasp of the war engine rules and will easily be able to incorporate them into the games that you play.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The datasheets for this scenario are on the next page and in Section <a href="#forces">5.0</a>.</p>

  {% h4 Gogard’s Last Stand %}

  <p>Warlord Gogard led an ill-advised invasion of the Imperial planet of Belle Alpha about ten years before the Battle For Armageddon. Trapped by Blood Angels Space Marine reinforcements, and with most of his boyz dead or dying, Gogard boarded his trusty Gargant <i>Korps Grinda</i> and set off for one last suicidal attack on the hated <q>beakies</q>. Gogard’s attack came as a complete surprise to the Blood Angels, who only managed to damage the Great Gargant before being forced to retreat from the awesome firepower of the war engine.</p>

  <p>Gogard carried on until he reached the main Imperial defence line. Here the Imperial defenders were much better prepared and raked the Gargant with heavy weapons fire as it advanced. The Gargant krew struggled to contain the fires raging inside the war engine, and were able to do so just long enough to allow <i>Korps Grinda</i> to cause immense destruction to the defenders before a massive explosion in the hull destroyed the Gargant and Warlord Gogard once and for all.</p>

  <p>Gogard’s last futile battle and glorious demise is a tale often retold around Ork campfires, with the result that a number of Ork Gargants on Armageddon are named <i>Korps Grinda</i> or a variation on the name (hey, nobody said that Orks were original!)</p>

  {% h3 Korps Grinda Returns! %}

  <p>In a strange quirk of fate, one of the Gargants named <i>Korps Grinda II</i> found itself surrounded and cut off far behind Imperial lines, and was left with no option other than to try to inflict as much damage as possible before it was destroyed. The stage was set for a reprise of Gogard’s Last Stand!</p>

  <dl class="dl-colonated">
    <dt>Ork Forces</dt>
    <dd>One formation consisting of <i>Korps Grinda II</i>, a Great Gargant (the datasheet is at the end of Section <a href="#ork-forces">5.5</a>) The force has a strategy rating of 3 and all formations have an initiative value of 3+. The Mob Rule (see <a href="#mob-rule"><em>Mob Rule</em></a>) and Power of the Waaagh (see <a href="#power-of-the-waaagh"><em>Power of the Waaagh!</em></a>) special rules apply to <i>Korps Grinda II</i>.</dd>

    <dt>Space Marine Forces</dt>
    <dd>One formation consisting of a Space Marine Commander, six Space Marine Tactical units and three Rhinos, plus one formation consisting of a Space Marine Commander and four Space Marine Devastator units, and one formation consisting of four Land Raiders. The force has a strategy rating of 5 and all formations have an initiative value of 1+. The <q>They Shall Know No Fear</q> special rule applies to all Space Marine formations (see <a href="#basic-training-scenario">Basic Training Scenario</a>).</dd>

    <dt>Gaming Area</dt>
    <dd>Set up the playing area approximately 90–120cm square, including the features shown on the accompanying map. Set up any further scenery you have in a mutually agreeable manner. The Space Marine player must set up two command bunkers when he deploys. These are the objectives of the Ork attack. They may be set up anywhere on the table that is at least 15cm from a table edge.</dd>
    <dd><img src="images/korps-grinda-returns.png" alt="Korps Grinda Returns Gaming Area" class="center-block img-responsive"></dd>

    <dt>Deployment</dt>
    <dd>The Space Marine player sets up first. One formation is deployed on the table, either in or touching the ruined buildings by the <q>Y</q> junction. The remaining two Space Marine formations enter play anywhere along the Space Marine table edge (including the roads) on the first turn of the battle. The Space Marine player must deploy one unit from each of these formations on the table edge to show where they will enter play. Their move on the first turn must be measured from this point. Once the Space Marines have deployed, the Ork Great Gargant may be set up as shown on the deployment map.</dd>

    <dt>Victory Conditions</dt>
    <dd>The game carries on until <i>Korps Grinda II</i> is destroyed or both objectives have been demolished. If the Space Marines destroy <i>Korps Grinda II</i> without losing either bunker then they win the game. If one bunker is destroyed then the game is a draw, and if the Orks destroy both bunkers then they win.</dd>
