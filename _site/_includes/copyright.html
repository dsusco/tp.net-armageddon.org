  <h4>What is <abbr title="Net Epic Armageddon">NetEA</abbr>?</h4>

  <p>Net Epic Armageddon, or <abbr title="Net Epic Armageddon">NetEA</abbr>, is the name of the Tactical Wargame Network’s development of fan-made rule extensions, army lists and army list updates for Games Workshop’s Epic Armageddon. The main focus of <abbr title="Net Epic Armageddon">NetEA</abbr> is to clarify the rules of Epic Armageddon and balance its tournament army lists against one another for the fun and enjoyment of all.</p>

  <h4>What is the Tournament Pack?</h4>

  <p>The <abbr title="Net Epic Armageddon">NetEA</abbr> Tournament Pack consists of the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The Epic Armageddon game rules and <strong>all</strong> of the errata that used to be found on Games Workshop’s Epic Armageddon Resources web page. All is stressed here as some errata was missing from the rulebook sections that used to be found on the web page above.</li>

    <li>The most up-to-date <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> available, essentially an expanded version of the <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> that used to be found on the web page above. Each Q&amp;A is a footnote in the appropriate section of the rules.</li>

    <li>All of the <abbr title="Net Epic Armageddon">NetEA</abbr> Approved tournament army lists and any rule extensions and Q&amp;A’s that accompany them. <abbr title="Net Epic Armageddon">NetEA</abbr> Approved army lists are tournament ready and balanced against one another using the Epic tournament game rules.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Will the Tournament Pack be updated?</h4>

  <p>Yes. The plan is to update the Tournament Pack every month, as needed.</p>

  <h4>Which version of the Tournament Pack is this?</h4>

  <p>Each Tournament Pack has its publication date on most of its pages, this is how it is versioned.</p>

  <h4>Where can I get the latest version of the Tournament Pack?</h4>

  <p>The <abbr title="Net Epic Armageddon">NetEA</abbr> Tournament Pack website (<a href="http://tp.net-armageddon.org/">tp.net-armageddon.org</a>).</p>

  <h4>What’s the best way to print the Tournament Pack?</h4>

  <p>Doubled-sided at 100% on either letter or A4-sized paper.</p>

  <h4>What’s a good forum for all things Epic?</h4>

  <p>Tactical Command (<a href="http://taccmd.tacticalwargames.net/">taccmd.tacticalwargames.net</a>) is, hands down, the best Epic forum there is.</p>

  <h4>I found an error/typo, where should I report it?</h4>

  <p>The TacComm forums.</p>

  <h4>Where can I find more Epic army lists?</h4>

  <p>TacComm has tons of them, and many are included in the <abbr title="Net Epic Armageddon">NetEA</abbr> Army List Compendium found on the <abbr title="Net Epic Armageddon">NetEA</abbr> website (<a href="http://www.net-armageddon.org/">net-armageddon.org</a>). They are clearly labelled as <abbr title="Net Epic Armageddon">NetEA</abbr> Approved, Developmental and Experimental so you have an idea on how well play-tested each list is. In addition, be sure to check out Epic-UK (<a href="http://epic-uk.co.uk/">epic-uk.co.uk</a>) or epic_fr (<a href="http://epic-fr.niceboard.com/">epic-fr.niceboard.com</a>) to see what the locals in your area are using.</p>

  <h4>Where can I buy Epic models?</h4>

  <p>At this point, the various forums that have been listed, eBay or Bartertown is your best bet for the out-of-print models. However, there are many 6mm science fiction manufacturers with products that make excellent proxies for Epic units. Most post on the TacComm forums.</p>

  <h4>Is this thing Games Workshop <q>official</q>?</h4>

  <p>Yes and no. While the rules presented here are those found in the Epic Armageddon rulebook, the <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQs</abbr> have been expanded upon based on what is available from Games Workshop.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the army lists presented here will have some price and composition differences when compared to what used to be provided on Games Workshop’s website. These changes were all done in the name of balance and have the support of the TacComm community. For the most part they are fairly minimal and should not be viewed as <q>game changing/breaking</q>.</p>

  <h4>Are the rules that used to be on Games Workshop’s Epic Armageddon Resources web page available anywhere?</h4>

  <p>Yes, they are on the <abbr title="Net Epic Armageddon">NetEA</abbr> website (<a href="http://www.net-armageddon.org/">net-armageddon.org</a>).</p>
