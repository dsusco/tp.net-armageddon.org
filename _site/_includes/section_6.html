    <p>Myriad are the ways of war. The lightning strike, the tenacious defence, the cunning ruse; all have their time and place, oft as not dictated by the lie of the land or balance of forces that you find at your disposal. The art of war is learning how to bind the tactics, terrain and forces at your command to your advantage.</p>

  <p>Tournament games are the single most popular form of Epic game. This is mainly because it is the easiest way to play Epic. All you have to do is use the army lists to collect an army, safe in the knowledge that you can use it to play an even and balanced game even against a complete stranger, something that is simply not possible with scenarios or campaigns. In order to achieve this happy state of affairs, tournament games require three things: <em>army lists</em>, <em>points values</em>, and a set of <em>tournament game rules</em>.</p>

  <p>An army list, as its name implies, is a list of units and formations that can be used by an army. What sets it apart from a simple order of battle, such as the forces included in the training scenarios presented earlier in this rulebook, is that it is a list of things you <em>can</em> use in your army rather than a list of things you <em>must</em> use. So, for example, a Space Marine army list would say something along the lines of: <q>You may have the following things in your army: Space Marine Tactical detachments, Space Marine Assault detachments, Space Marine Terminator detachments…</q> and so on. Army lists usually focus on one army, for example Space Marines, or Imperial Guard, or Orks, though some cover combined or allied forces. In addition, army lists can either be <q>generic</q> and cover all armies of that type, or <q>specific</q> and cover a particular army or famous regiment. For example, a generic Space Marine army list would allow you to collect any Chapter, while a Blood Angels army list would only allow Blood Angel units to be used. The advantage of specific lists is that they can include more interesting and characterful units, while a generic list lacks this level of detail but gives the player more freedom in terms of painting and modelling.</p>

  <p>Of course, if players were simply allowed to pick any units or formations they liked from an army list then there is no way that tournament games could be fair—the player with the largest collection of models would always have a big advantage! Because of this, each formation and unit in an army list is given a points value The points value shows how effective the unit or formation is when it is used in a tournament game. So, for example, a mighty Baneblade tank would cost many more points than a humble Leman Russ, as the Baneblade will have a much greater impact on the course of the game. Players are then given the freedom to choose troops from their army list to a set points value. For example, players might agree to play a 2,000 point game, in which case each could pick troops worth 2,000 points from their own army list. As long as the army lists have been worked out properly, then any two armies with the same points value will have an equal chance of winning, although the actual composition of each army may be radically different, even if both are chosen from the same list. Returning to our prior example, one player might choose to take a few Baneblades, while his opponent chooses to take a horde of Leman Russ, but as long as the points values for the two units have been worked out properly then each player will have the same chance of winning the game.</p>

  <p>The final piece of the jigsaw is the tournament game rules. In order to create a fair and balanced contest, tournament games need to have a method of setting up the terrain, deploying the armies, and determining the winner that is as even as possible for both sides. These are known as the tournament game rules, and they need to be set out in advance along with the army lists, so that a player can choose his army knowing what sort of battle he will be fighting. Because of the desire to create an even contest, tournament game rules tend to be quite simple. Terrain will usually be kept to a minimum and not include too many exotic features, and both armies will usually deploy in a <q>set-up zone</q> near their own table edge. Victory conditions can be quite complex, but will almost always be the same for both sides (a process called <q>mirroring</q>). A very common set of tournament game victory conditions is to play for a certain number of turns, and then for each player to count up the points value of destroyed enemy units to see who has won. A variation on this theme is for each player to place a certain number of <q>objective markers</q> in the opposing half of the table, with the winner being the player that has captured the most objectives at the end of the game. Previous versions of Epic have used a combination of these two methods, with players winning points for destroying the enemy and capturing objectives, to determine the winner. However, whatever rules are actually used, the aim is always to create as even a contest as possible between the two armies picked from the army lists, and this usually leads to fairly straight-forward <q>line up and fight</q> battles with a minimum of terrain and mirrored victory conditions for both sides.</p>

  <p>The overall effect of this is to create a game that is ideal for <q>pick-up</q> games between two players that have not met each other before. Tournament games allow the player to simply go ahead and collect an army, choosing whichever models they like within the constraints of the army list, and then turn up at a club or gaming event, find an opponent, and play knowing that the game will be as fair and even as possible.</p>

  {% h2 Epic Tournament Game Rules %}

  <p>The Epic tournament game rules are designed to be used in conjunction with the Epic tournament army lists. They will allow two players to fight an evenly balanced battle with little or no preparation. They are ideal for pick-up games at clubs or shows, and provide an evenly balanced contest in tournaments.</p>

  <p>In many ways, tournament games represent the most <q>basic</q> form of game play, and are designed to be as easy and accessible as possible in order to allow Epic players to play games with the minimum of fuss. Because of this, the tournament rules require little or no preparation other than picking forces from the army lists, while the army lists are designed to work with the packaged range of Epic miniatures produced by Games Workshop, making it easy for players to put together an army. Later sections include rather more advanced rules and guidelines that will allow experienced players to design their own unique formations and units for use in scenarios or campaigns of their own devising.</p>

  {% h3 Forces %}

  <p>Both players pick armies to an agreed points total between 2,000 to 5,000 points using the tournament army lists. It is possible to play games using the tournament rules for larger or smaller games than this, but please note that the army lists have been balanced assuming that armies will fall within this range, and this means that larger or smaller games may be slightly unbalanced.</p>

  {% h3 Set-up %}

  <p>Set up the terrain for the game in any mutually agreeable manner. If one player sets up the terrain then his opponent may choose where to deploy. If you set up the terrain as a joint effort or it was set up by a tournament organiser then the player with the higher strategy rating may choose the table edge he sets up on. If both players have the same strategy rating, then dice to see who gets the choice of table edge. You can pick a long edge, or a corner (half way up each long and short edge). The opponent sets up on the opposite edge or corner.</p>

  <p>The tournament game rules have been designed to be played on tables that are 90–150cm wide by 150–240cm long (that’s 3–5 feet by 5–8 feet for you non-metric types!) The ideal size is round-about 120cm by 180cm (4 feet by 6 feet). It is possible to play games on tables that are wider or longer than this, but this may favour certain armies and could lead to an unbalanced game.</p>

  <aside class="design-concept pull-down">
    <header>Tournament Terrain</header>

    <div>
      <p>The tournament game rules will work on any type of terrain. However, especially dense or extremely sparse terrain will favour some armies or troop choices over others. An Ork army with a lot of Boyz will do well on a table covered with lots of terrain, for example, while an Ork army with lots of buggies and gunwagons will do better on a table with sparse terrain. In addition, certain terrain features can favour one army over another. Having a river running the length of the table will favour an army with a lot of skimmers and aircraft. You get the idea, I’m sure.</p>

      <p>Because of this, we recommend you use the following guidelines when setting up terrain for tournament games. These are not a set of hard and fast rules, but if they are used will ensure a well-balanced game no matter what army or units are taken.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>We recommend the use of terrain features when playing tournament games in preference to modular terrain (see the Appendices for a more detailed description of the two types of terrain).</li>
        <li>Terrain features can be of pretty much any type, but should be roughly 15–30cm across. Hills can be up to twice this size. See below for a note of how to deal with rivers and roads.</li>
        <li>Divide the table into 60cm (2 foot) square areas. The total number of terrain features placed should be equal to twice the number of 60cm square areas. For example, if you were playing on a 120cm by 180 cm, you would have six areas and should place 12 terrain features.</li>
        <li>Within the limits above, place between 0–4 features in each 60cm square.</li>
        <li>The terrain may include one river. Rivers count as a terrain feature for each area that they run through. They need to enter on one table edge and leave from another, and should not be greater in length than the shortest table edge. For example, on a 120cm by 180cm table, the river should not be more than 120cm long. There should be a bridge or ford every 30cm along the river.</li>
        <li>Roads may be added after all terrain features have been placed. Any number of roads may be used. They need to enter on one table edge and either exit from another or end at a terrain feature.</li>
      </ul>

  {% h3 The Five Minute Warm Up .column-break %}

  <p>Tabletop miniatures wargaming is not an exact science. One person’s line of sight is another’s blocked line of fire, some people love pre-measuring, others hate it, and so on. Because of this after you have set up the terrain for a game you should spend five minutes going through things like how the line of fire rules will work, how the terrain features used will work, and so on. Here are some of the things you may want to discuss:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <q>Counts As</q> Rule (see <a href="#the-counts-as-rule">The <q>Counts As</q> Rule</a>).</li>
    <li>Lines of Sight and Lines Of Fire.</li>
    <li>Fire Arcs on units.</li>
    <li>Pre-measuring.</li>
    <li>Templates and if units are <q>in or out</q>.</li>
    <li>Terrain features—what do they count as on the terrain chart, when are units <q>in</q> terrain.</li>
    <li>How you will show if a formation is broken, in overwatch or has marched this turn.</li>
    <li>Anything else you can think of!</li>
  </ul>

  {% h3 Place Objective Markers .column-break %}

  <p>Take it in turns, starting with the player with the higher strategy rating, to place one objective marker on the table. If both players have the same strategy rating then dice to see who places the first objective marker.</p>

  <p>The first objective a player sets up must be placed on their own table edge. The remaining two objectives must be set up in their opponent’s half of the table, at least 30cm away from the opponent’s table edge and 30cm away from any other objectives that have already been placed.</p>

  <p>Keep placing objectives until six objective markers have been placed on the table in total. You can use anything as an objective marker but we would suggest using terrain pieces to represent them if you can. In our games, we’ve found that battling over an actual bunker or fuel dump is far more appealing than having your forces sell their lives for a cardboard counter!</p>

  <p>You capture an objective if you have a unit within 15cms of it in the end phase and your opponent does not. An objective is contested if both sides have a unit within 15cms of it in the end phase. Units from broken formations or from formations that have rallied that end phase can not capture or contest objectives. Aircraft which have landed may not capture an objective on the same turn that it lands. However, a landed aircraft may immediately contest an objective.</p>

  <p>Check at the end of each turn to see how many objectives you control. Objectives do not have a <q>memory</q> and you will lose control of any you have captured if there are no friendly units within 15cms of them at the end of any subsequent turn.</p>

  {% h3 Setup Spacecraft &amp; Garrisons .column-break %}

  <p>If either player is using spacecraft then they are set up now before any other units (see <a href="#spacecraft">Spacecraft</a>). Units entering play via planetfall should be placed to one side at this time too (see <a href="#planetfall">Planetfall</a>).</p>

  <p>On-table garrison units are set up after spacecraft have been set up. The following types of formations may be set up on the table as <q>garrisons</q> at the start of the game:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Formations where half or more of the units (rounding up) are scouts <span class="text-uppercase">or</span></li>
    <li>Formations where no more than one of the units has a move greater than 15cms, and where none of the units are war engines <span class="text-uppercase">or</span></li>
    <li>Any formations that include units with a speed of 0 (zero).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Players take it in turns to set up one garrison at a time, starting with the player with the higher strategy rating. Garrisons must be set up so that they have at least one unit within 15cm of an objective in the player’s own half of the table. No units may be set up in the opponent’s half of the table or in impassable terrain. Units may be set up in dangerous terrain (it’s assumed that they took their time getting into position in order to do so safely!)</p>

  <p>Each player may start up to two of their garrisoned formations on Overwatch. These formations represent sentries deployed as a trip wire and to provide security at the objectives. They are assumed to have gone on Overwatch in their previous Action phase. That Overwatch is <q>carried over</q> into the first turn.</p>

  {% h3 Set-up Remaining Formations .column-break %}

  <p>All of the remaining formations in the players’ armies must be set up within 15cms of their own side’s table edge or be kept back <q>in reserve</q>. The players take it in turn to set up these formations one at a time, starting with the player with the higher strategy rating.</p>

  <p>Units kept in reserve must either be aircraft, or be going to enter play in a transport aircraft or by teleportation. Reserve formations entering play in aircraft or by teleportation should be placed aside with units that will enter play via planetfall. These formations are not <q>secret</q> and your opponent may inspect them at any time.</p>

  <p>Units being transported must start the game already loaded into the transport vehicle that will bring them into play (i.e., an aircraft or unit with the planetfall ability).</p>

  <p>Formations entering play in aircraft or from spacecraft can do so on any turn, following the rules for transport aircraft and planetfall (see <a href="#transporting-ground-units">Transporting Ground Units</a> and <a href="#planetfall">Planetfall</a>). Formations that are in reserve may not carry out <em>any</em> game functions or use special abilities they may have.</p>

  {% h3 Victory Conditions .column-break %}

  <p>You must check to see if either player has won at the end of the third and fourth game turns. If neither player has won at the end of the fourth turn then the <q>tiebreaker</q> rule is used to determine the winner.</p>

  <p>Each player is trying to achieve five things known as goals. You win if you have achieved two of these goals in the end phase of turns three or four, and you have achieved more goals than your opponent. The five goals are: <em>Blitzkrieg</em>, <em>Break Their Spirit</em>, <em>Defend The Flag</em>, <em>Take And Hold</em>, and <em>They Shall Not Pass</em>.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Blitzkrieg</dt>
    <dd>You achieve this goal by capturing the objective that was set up on the opponent’s table edge at the start of the game (i.e., the first objective each player set up).</dd>

    <dt>Break Their Spirit</dt>
    <dd>You achieve this goal by destroying (not breaking) the formation worth the most points in the opposing army. If several formations are tied for the most points, you achieve this goal by destroying any one of them.</dd>

    <dt>Defend To Flag</dt>
    <dd>You achieve this goal if you control all three objectives in your half of the table.</dd>

    <dt>Take And Hold</dt>
    <dd>You achieve this goal by capturing a total of two objectives in your opponent’s half of the table.</dd>

    <dt>They Shall Not Pass</dt>
    <dd>You achieve this goal if there are no unbroken enemy formations in your half of the table.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>If neither player has won at the end of the fourth or any subsequent turn then both players roll a D6 to see if the game carries on another turn or ends in a tiebreak. If both players roll the same number then the game carries on for another turn and the players must roll again at the end of the next turn to see if the game ends or carries on another turn, and so on.</p>

  <p>If the players roll different numbers then the game ends in a tiebreak. Each player scores a number of <em>victory points</em> equal to the full points value of any enemy formations that have been completely destroyed, plus the full points value of any enemy formations that are broken <em>and</em> have been reduced to half strength or less, plus half the value of any formation reduced to half strength or less but is not broken, plus half the value of any formation that is broken but is above half strength. Whoever has the higher points score is the winner. For the purpose of this rule, a formation’s <q>strength</q> is equal to the number of units in the formation plus the (remaining) damage capacity of any war engines.</p>

  {% h2 Tournament Army Lists %}

  <blockquote>
    <p>Do not throw your forces blindly into battle. Before committing your forces, examine the situation. Review your own strength, and that of your enemy. Remember your own objectives, and try to anticipate those of your opponent. Then select those of your troops best suited to the task in hand.</p>

    <footer><cite>Imperium Tactica</cite></footer>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The following army lists are designed to work with the range of models produced by Games Workshop for Epic, and will produce a closely balanced game when used along with the tournament game rules (see <a href="#epic-tournament-game-rules">Epic Tournament Game Rules</a>).</p>

  <p>Although each army list is based on one particular fighting force, they are typical of many other similar armies, and so all of these lists can be used as <q>stand in</q> lists for players that may already have collected an Epic army from a previous edition of the rules.</p>

  <p>In order to use the army lists, you and your opponent must agree upon a points total for the game that you will play, and then select formations from the army lists that are equal to or less than this value. For example, you might agree to play a 3,000 point game, in which case you would both pick formations whose points value comes to 3,000 points or less.</p>

  <p>The attached army lists provide points value for all of the models available in the Epic range. The <q>counts as</q> rule opposite will make it easy for you to use non-standard models in your games, and the appendices at the end of this book include sections on how to use models that are no longer in production from older versions of Epic in your games too. Our aim is to make it as easy as possible for players to use all of the models in their collection without receiving an unfair advantage by so doing, and as long as you use the rules in this spirit you will find your games all the better for it.</p>

  <p>Each army list is broken down into four parts:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Forces</dt>
    <dd>This section tells you which datasheets to use from Section <a href="#forces">5.0</a>.</dd>

    <dt>Using The Army List</dt>
    <dd>This section tells you how to use the army list, and covers the different types of formation used by the army and how they can be selected from the list.</dd>

    <dt>Special Rules</dt>
    <dd>The special rules that apply to the army list.</dd>

    <dt>The Army List</dt>
    <dd>The army list describes the formations that can be used in the army, the units that make up each formation, and gives a points value for each formation. It also includes the army’s strategy rating and the initiative rating for any formations in the army. The datasheets for all of the units in the armies can be found in the Forces section (see <a href="#forces">Forces</a>).</dd>
  </dl>

  <div class="page-break pull-up special-rule">
    {% h3 The ‘Counts As’ Rule %}

    <div>
      <p>You may if you wish decide that certain units in your army <q>count as</q> something else from the army lists that is of roughly the same size and function. This is especially useful if you are using old models that are no longer in the range and therefore not covered in the army lists, or you are using models that are painted differently. For example, you might have managed to lay your hands on some of the old metal Ork Squigoth models that we made many years ago but that are now no longer in the range. Rather than leaving these models languishing on the shelf you could simply decide that they <q>count as</q> Ork Battlewagons, which are roughly the same size as a Squigoth and have a similar function. Alternatively, you may have decided to use the Steel Legion army list to represent a different Imperial Guard regiment with a very different colour scheme. Again, it would be a great shame not to be able to use your gorgeously painted army, and the <q>counts as</q> rule will allow you to do so. However, if you decide to use the <q>counts as</q> rule, then there are three very important things to bear in mind:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>First of all, before the game starts you must tell your opponent that you have decided to use the <q>counts as</q> rule, and you must let him know what counts as what.</li>
        <li>Secondly, this rule is here to allow you to use all the models in your collection, not as a method of fine-tuning your army for every game that you play. Therefore you may not use the <q>counts as</q> rule for units that are actually covered in the army lists. For example, if you have a model of a Land Speeder, then you must use it as a Land Speeder and pay the points for a Land Speeder; you could not use it as a Land Speeder Tornado, or a Predator, or any other unit for that matter. By the same token, a Land Speeder Tornado must be used as a Land Speeder Tornado and can’t stand in for any other units. This rule is included to prevent confusion and keep game play as even and balanced as possible. Note that you can paint the unit in any way you like, you just can’t count it as a different unit from the list.</li>
        <li>Finally, if you decide that any unit in your army <q>counts as</q> something else, then all of that type of unit in your army must count as the same thing. For example, if you decided that your old Squigoth model was a Battlewagon, then all the Squigoths in your army would have to be Battlewagons—you couldn’t have one Squigoth as a Battlewagon, one as a Gunwagon, and so on.</li>
