    <aside class="short-story">
    Below was some sort of Humie supply dump, with stacks of crates and barrels, and Imperial Guardsmen scuttling around dousing fires. Skargrim grinned and sounded the Waaagh-horn before kicking his driver to go faster. Around him, the massed vehicles of the Speed Kult raced down towards the shocked Humies at full throttle. Warbuggies vied with bikes and Traks to cover the ground the fastest, Trukks packed with Boyz careened against each other as they fought to get ahead, the greenskins’ shouts inaudible over the thunder of engines. The column of ramshackle, bellowing vehicles snaked and twisted like a living thing as it converged on its prey.

    Unlike the very rigid formations used by the Imperium, Ork formations vary widely in both size and composition. The rules for creating Ork formations reflect this. The different types of Ork formations you may choose are shown on the army list that follows. The army list includes the following information:

    Type
    : The name of the formation.

    Core Units
    : The units that make up the formation. An Ork player can choose to double or triple the number of units in the formation if he wishes. A formation with double the normal number of units is called a _big_ formation, and a formation with three times the normal number of units is called a _’uge_ formation.

    Cost
    : Most Ork formations have three values. The first value is the cost for the basic formation, the second is its cost if it is a big formation, and the third value is its cost if it is a ’uge formation. If the formation only has one cost then it may not be increased in size. Up to one third of the points available to an Ork army can be spent on aircraft and Gargants.

    Extra Units
    : An Ork formation may include any of the extra units listed in the <q>Extras</q> column. You may include any number of extra units in a formation unless it is specifically noted otherwise. If there is a limitation then the limit is doubled for a big formation and tripled for a ’uge formation. All of the core, extra, and free units in an Ork formation count as being part of one large formation. The different units may not move off on their own.

<p>Burning Death Speed Freek armies have a strategy rating of 3. All formations have an initiative rating of 3+, but receive modifiers depending on the action chosen when taking an action test (see <a href="#power-of-the-waaagh"><em>Power of the Waaagh!</em></a>), or the size of the formation when rallying (see <a href="#mob-rule"><em>Mob Rule</em></a>).</p>
