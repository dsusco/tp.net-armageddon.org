    The following army list allows you to field an Imperial Guard army that is based on an Tahnelian Airborne regiment. It can also be used as a <q>stand in</q> army list for other Imperial Guard drop troop regiments, such as Elysian Drop Troops, Garlatan Drop Legion or Mistian Para-Troops, among many others.

    Tahnelian Airborne formations come in two types: _platoons_ and _support formations_. Each platoon you include in the army allows you to field any two support formations. Although you can only take a support formation if you first take a platoon, they are treated as separate independent formations during a battle and do not have to move around together.

    In addition, platoons may be given up to three upgrades. Each type of upgrade can only be taken once by a platoon. Upgrades are added to the platoon and are not a separate formation. Support formations may not be given platoon upgrades. Each upgrade that is taken adds to the cost of the platoon, as shown on the upgrade chart.

    Tahnelian Airborne Imperial Guard armies may be supported by Imperial Navy aircraft and Titan Legion battlegroups. A maximum of up to a third of the points available to the army may be spent on these formations.
