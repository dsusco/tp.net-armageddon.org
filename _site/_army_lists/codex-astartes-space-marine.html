name: Codex Astartes Space Marine
introduction:
  |
    > The Codex Astartes is the holy tome of these loyal Battle Brothers. The wisdom of the ancients is both scripture and the unbending rod by which they are measured. In war, they are fierce and as steadfast as those of old who stood beside the Emperor and broke the Legions of Horus. In faith and valour they are unmatched. The torches of their chapels burn bright with flames whose holy fire has shone upon an unchanging brotherhood for a hundred centuries. In their lives and in war, the Codex Astartes is their guide.

    The following army list allows you to field an army based on one of the Space Marine Chapters that closely follows the teachings of the Codex Astartes. It can also be used as a <q>stand in</q> army list for other Space Marine Chapters that do not follow the Codex Astartes, such as the Blood Angels, Dark Angels and Space Wolves.

    Space Marines are organised into small formations called _detachments_. Each detachment is made up of one or more units, and may also include a number of extra units called _upgrades_.

    The detachments that may be taken in a Codex Astartes army are shown on the chart that follows. The chart also shows what units comprise the detachment, what upgrades are allowed, and its points cost. For example, an Assault detachment consists of four Space Marine Assault units for 175 points, and may include the Commander and Vindicator upgrades at an additional cost in points.

    Each upgrade that is taken adds to the cost of the detachment, as shown on the _upgrade chart_. The upgrade chart also lists the units that make up the upgrade. Note that these will sometimes replace units in the detachment they are taken for, and sometimes takes the form of additional units for the detachment. Each upgrade may be taken once per formation. For example, an Assault detachment could include one Commander and one Vindicator. If both were taken it would cost 175 + 50 +75 = 300 points.

    Codex Astartes armies may be supported by Imperial Navy aircraft and Titan Legion battlegroups. A maximum of up to a third of the points available to the army may be spent on these formations.
