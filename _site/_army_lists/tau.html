    <blockquote>
      <p>We are not here to bring death and destruction to you, Gue’la. Even though your armed forces have laid waste to our systems, bombarded our cities and slaughtered my fellow Tau, we are not here for revenge. We are here to offer you to share our culture and profit from our technology and protection.

      <p>We are not here to take your homes, your families and your beliefs away from you. You can even continue to worship your Emperor-god if you want, you must only swear fealty to the advancement of the Greater Good, which will benefit all members of the empire alike.</p>

      <p>We are not here to turn you all into soldiers and demand of you to fight against your former kin. Some of you will be asked to join our armed forces, in return for the protection that we grant to your planet. But if you are unwilling to fight against Humans from the Imperium, you will not be deployed against them. We are not here to enslave you, but to welcome you into our empire, the empire of the Tau.</p>

    Tau formations come in two types: cadres and support formations. Each cadre you include in the army allows you to field any three support formations. Although you can only take a support formation if you first take a cadre, they are treated as separate independent formations during a battle and do not have to move around together. The formations that may be taken in a Tau Third Phase Expansion army are shown on the chart that follows. The chart also shows what units comprise the formations, what upgrades they are allowed, and their points cost.

    In addition, formations may be given up to three upgrades. Each upgrade that is taken adds to the cost of the formation, as shown on the upgrade chart. The upgrade chart also lists the units that make up the upgrade. Each upgrade may be taken once per formation.

    Tau Third Phase Expansion armies may be supported by Air Caste formations. A maximum of up to a third of the points available to the army may be spent on these formations.
