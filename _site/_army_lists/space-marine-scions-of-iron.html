    <blockquote>
      <p>They called us weak, betrayers and traitors. But they were wrong. It was not us that were lost and had left the path, but themselves. For they had forgotten the pride of Marines. We are enhanced already. We are the beacon of mankind and should not be hide away but lead in front. So we turned and walked away from them. Not because we were betraying the chapter, but because by staying we would betray the Emperor.</p>

      <p>They call us traitor. but remember that we call them brothers. For us, all the Marines are the Emperor’s chosen. For us, all the Marines are united as Emperor’s divine instruments. For us, all Marines are brothers.</p>

    The following army list allows you to field an army based on one of the Scions of Iron Space Marine Chapter that fought during the Invasion of Telgar VI.

    Space Marines are organised into small formations called _detachments_. Each detachment is made up of one or more units, and may also include a number of extra units called _upgrades_.

    The detachments that may be taken in a Scions of Iron army are shown on the chart that follows. The chart also shows what units comprise the detachment, what upgrades are allowed, and its points cost.

    Each upgrade that is taken adds to the cost of the detachment, as shown on the _upgrade chart_. The upgrade chart also lists the units that make up the upgrade. Note that these will sometimes replace units in the detachment they are taken for, and sometimes takes the form of additional units for the detachment. Each upgrade may be taken once per formation.

    Scions of Iron armies may be supported by Imperial Navy aircraft and Titan Legion battlegroups. No more than two of each of these formations may be included in the army. In addition a maximum of up to a third of the points available to the army may be spent on these formations and Scions of Iron aircraft formations.
