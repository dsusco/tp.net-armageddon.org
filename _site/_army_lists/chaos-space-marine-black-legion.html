      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>Ten thousand years ago, the Imperium of Man was beset by a devastating civil war known as the Horus Heresy. Several Space Marine Legions rebelled against the <q>False Emperor</q> under the persuasive-yetcorrupt leadership of Warmaster Horus, a former lieutenant of the Emperor who fell under Chaos’ sway. Space Marine fought brother Space Marine, culminating in a final battle at the Imperial Palace on Holy Terra.</p>

        <p>Though the forces of the Imperium were victorious, the Emperor of Mankind was mortally wounded and encased in the Golden Throne to sustain his life. Meanwhile, the surviving rebel Space Marines fled for the Eye of Terror, a massive Warp storm on the northeastern edge of the galaxy. Here, warpspace mixed with realspace and the Daemons of Chaos could manifest themselves.</p>

        <p>The traitor Space Marines took refuge in the Eye of Terror, launching raids and Black Crusades from their maelstrom base. These Chaos Space Marines became an endless plague upon the Imperium, wreaking havoc in the name of their Chaos Gods.</p>

using_the_army_list:

    The following army list allows you to field a Chaos Space Marine army based on Abbadon’s Black Legion. It can also be used as a <q>stand in</q> army list for other Traitor Legions, such as the Death Guard, World Eaters, Night Lords and Iron Warriors.

    Black Legion formations come in three types: _retinues_, _elite formations_ and _support formation_. Each retinue you include in the army allows you to field any one elite formation and any two support formations. Although you can only take an elite or support formation if you first take a retinue, they are treated as separate independent formations during the battle and do not have to move around together.

    In addition, formations may be given up to four upgrades but each upgrade may only be taken once per formation. Which upgrades a formation may be given are listed in the <q>Upgrades</q> column. Upgrades are added to the formation and are not a separate formation. Each upgrade that is taken adds to the cost of the formation, as shown on the upgrade chart.

    Black Legion armies may be supported by Chaos Navy and War Engine formations. Up to a third of the points available to the army may be spent on these formations.
