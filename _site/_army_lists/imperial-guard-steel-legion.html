    The following army list allows you to field an Imperial Guard army that is based on an Armageddon Steel Legion regiment. It can also be used as a <q>stand in</q> army list for other Imperial Guard regiments, such as Cadian Shock Troops, Mordian Iron Guard or Valhallan Ice Warriors, among many others. Note that we have based the number of units in the infantry formations on what will be found in a typical field formation, rather than what is found in a full-strength company when first enlisted.

    Steel Legion formations come in two types: _companies_ and _support formations_. Each company you include in the army allows you to field any two support formations. Although you can only take a support formation if you first take a company, they are treated as separate independent formations during a battle and do not have to move around together. For example, taking a Steel Legion Tank Company would entitle you to take two formations from the support formation chart. If you decided to take an artillery battery then it and the tank company would operate as two separate formations.

    In addition, companies may be given up to three company upgrades. Each type of upgrade can only be taken once by a company (i.e., an infantry company could have an Ogryn and a Sniper upgrade, but not two Sniper upgrades). Upgrades are added to the company and are not a separate formation. Support formations may not be given company upgrades. Each upgrade that is taken adds to the cost of the company, as shown on the upgrade chart. For example, if you took a Tank Company and added a mechanised infantry platoon to it as an upgrade, then the cost of the tank company would be 650 + 100 + 75 (for the Chimera) = 825 points. Note that you may take any type of upgrade for any type of company; so, for example, if you want to include a platoon of Leman Russ tanks in an infantry company or snipers in a Tank Company then you may do so.

    Armageddon Steel Legion Imperial Guard armies may be supported by Imperial Navy aircraft and Titan Legion battlegroups. A maximum of up to a third of the points available to the army may be spent on these formations.
