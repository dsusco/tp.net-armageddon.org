    The following army list allows you to field an Imperial Guard army that is based on a Siege regiment of the type typified by the Baran Siegemasters. It can also be used as a <q>stand in</q> army list for other Imperial Guard Siege regiments, other kinds of static defence regiment, as well as being an excellent army list to use to represent the planetary defence forces fielded by Imperial Governors all across the Imperium.

    Baran Siegemaster formations come in two types: _companies_ and _support formations_. Each company you include in the army allows you to field any two support formations, plus one set of Fortified Positions. Although you can only take a support formation if you first take a company, they are treated as separate independent formations during a battle and do not have to move around together.

    In addition, companies may be given up to three company upgrades. Each type of upgrade can only be taken once by a company. Upgrades are added to the company and are not a separate formation. Support formations may not be given company upgrades. Each upgrade that is taken adds to the cost of the company, as shown on the upgrade chart. Note that you may take any type of upgrade for any type of company.

    Baran Siegemasters Imperial Guard armies may be supported by Imperial Navy aircraft. A maximum of up to a fourth of the points available to the army may be spent on these formations.
