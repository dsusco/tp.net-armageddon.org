    The following army list allows you to field an army based on the Raven Guard, or one of their successor chapters, using their preferred operational methods.

    Raven Guard formations come in three types: _detachments_, _elite detachments_ and _support detachments_. Each formation is made up of one or more units, and may also include a number of extra units called _upgrades_. Each detachment you include in the army allows you to field any one elite detachment and any one support detachment. Although you can only take elite and support detachments if you first take a detachment, they are treated as separate independent formations during a battle and do not have to move around together.

    The formations that may be taken in a Raven Guard army are shown on the charts that follow. The charts also show what units comprise them, what upgrades they are allowed, and their points cost. For example, an Assault detachment consists of four Space Marine Assault units for 175 points, and may include the Commander and Land Speeders upgrades at an additional cost in points.

    Each upgrade that is taken adds to the cost of the formation, as shown on the _upgrades_ chart. The upgrades chart also lists the units that make up the upgrade. These can replace units in the formation they are taken for or be additional units added to the formation. Each upgrade may be taken once per formation. For example, an Assault detachment could include one Commander and make the cost of the formation 225 points (175 + 50).

    Raven Guard armies may be supported by Imperial Navy aircraft, Raven Guard aircraft and Titan Legion battlegroups formations. A maximum of a third of the points available to the army may be spent on these formations.
