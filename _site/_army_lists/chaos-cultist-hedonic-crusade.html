    The following army list allows you to field a Slaanesh Chaos Cult army based on the Hedonic Crusade launched by House Devine in the early part of the 41<sup>st</sup> Millennium.

    Hedonic Crusade formations come in two types: _House Devine Knight Households_ and _vassal formations_. Each House Devine Knight Household you include in the army allows you to field any one vassal formation. Although you can only take a vassal formation if you first take a House Devine Knight Household, they are treated as separate independent formations during the battle and do not have to move around together. In addition, each Hedonic Crusade army may a Daemon Pool.

    The army list includes the following information:

    Formation
    : The name of the formation.

    Units
    : The core units that make up the formation.

    Extras
    : A formation may include any of the extra units listed in the <q>Extras</q> column. You may include any number of extra units in a formation unless it is specifically noted otherwise. All of the core and extra units in a formation count as being part of one formation. The different units may not move off on their own.

    Cost
    : The points value of the formation.
