        <p>In the depths of the Dark City, in the dark vacuums of the gulf between the stars and the recesses of the Webway, the Lords of the Dark Kin attend to their courts. Flanked by the insidious Incubi, the Lords attend their duties. The delicacy of choirs of tortured souls, the feasting upon innumerable slaves, the slaughter of populations—their undertaking is tireless.</p>

    Kabal of Pain’s Way Dark Eldar formations come in two types: _kabals_ and _partisans_. Each kabal you include in the army allows you to field any two partisan formations. Although you can only take a partisans formation if you first take a kabal, they are treated as separate independent formations during a battle and do not have to move around together.

    In addition, formations may be given upgrades. Which upgrades a formation may be given are listed in the <q>Upgrades</q> column. Upgrades are added to the formation and are not a separate formation. Each upgrade that is taken adds to the cost of the formation, as shown on the upgrade chart. Note that you may never exceed more than eight infantry units in a formation.

    Dark Eldar armies may be supported by Dark Eldar Aircraft, Spacecraft and Other Horror formations. A maximum of up to a third of the points available to the army may be spent on these formations.

    Finally, Dark Eldar Individuals includes special characters, formations and objective options. Each individual may only be taken once by the army. The rules for using each individual are listed in the <q>Notes</q> column.

    The _Hit &amp; Run Tactics_ rule (see [_Hit &amp; Run Tactics_](#dark-eldar-hit-and-run-tactics)) and _Fleet of Foot_ rule (see [_Fleet of Foot_](#fleet-of-foot)) apply to all Dark Eldar formations. Additionally, certain units and weapons have special abilities described in _Dark Eldar Technology_ (see [_Dark Eldar Technology_](#dark-eldar-technology)).
