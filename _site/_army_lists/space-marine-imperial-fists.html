    The following army list allows you to field an army based on a Imperial Fists Space Marine army. It can also be used as a <q>stand in</q> army list for any of the Imperial Fists’ successor chapters.

    Space Marines are organised into small formations called _detachments_. Each detachment is made up of one or more units, and may also include a number of extra units called _upgrades_.

    The detachments that may be taken in a Imperial Fists army are shown on the chart that follows. The chart also shows what units comprise the detachment, what upgrades are allowed, and its points cost.

    Each upgrade that is taken adds to the cost of the detachment, as shown on the _upgrade chart_. The upgrade chart also lists the units that make up the upgrade. Note that these will sometimes replace units in the detachment they are taken for, and sometimes takes the form of additional units for the detachment. Each upgrade may be taken once per formation.

    Imperial Fist armies may be supported by Titan Legion battlegroups, and Imperial Fist aircraft and static defence formations. A maximum of up to a third of the points available to the army may be spent on these formations.
