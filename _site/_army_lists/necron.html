        <p>The Necron are an ancient race whose origins are a mystery to the scholars of the Imperium. What precious little information has been learned from interrogations of Eldar who themselves only have stories that have become little more than legends. Known to the Eldar as the Yngir, the Necron are the remnants of an ancient race called the Necrontyr.</p>

    Scarab Conflict Necron formations come in three types, the first two are phalanxes and support formations. Each phalanx you include in the army allows you to field any three support formations. Although you can only take a support formation if you first take a phalanx, they are treated as separate independent formations during a battle and do not have to move around together. The third type of formation are Harvestor formations. A maximum of up to a third of the points available to the army may be spent on these formations.

    Finally, Necron Individuals includes special characters, formations and objective options. Each individual may only be taken once by the army. The rules for using each individual are listed in the <q>Notes</q> column.

    The army list includes the following information:

    Formation
    : The name of the formation.

    Units
    : The core units that make up the formation.

    Extras
    : A Necron formation may include any of the extra units listed in the <q>Extras</q> column. You may include any number of extra units in a formation unless it is specifically noted otherwise. All of the core and extra units in a formation count as being part of one formation. The different units may not move off on their own.

    Cost
    : The points value of the formation.

    The _Implacable Advance_ rule applies to all Necron formations (see [_Implacable Advance_](#implacable-advance)) and the _Phase Out_ rule applies to certain formations (see [_Phase Out_](#phase-out)). Additionally, certain units and weapons have special abilities described in _Necron Technology_ (see [_Necron Technology_](#necron-technology)).
