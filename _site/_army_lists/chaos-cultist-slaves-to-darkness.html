    <blockquote>
      <p>Like the great storm of the Horus Heresy, the forces of the True Gods will descend upon the Emperor’s minions. The stars will tremble at their passage and the mighty armadas of the Warmaster Abaddon will bring annihilation to a hundred worlds. Know this, for these things will come to pass.</p>

    The following army list allows you to field a Chaos Cult army based on the Slaves to Darkness Cult that has arisen countless times over the millennia across the galaxy. It can also be used as a <q>stand in</q> army list for other Cult armies.

    Chaos Cultist formations come in two types: _covens_ and _support covens_. Each coven you include in the army allows you to field any two support covens. Although you can only take a support coven is you first take a coven, they are treated as separate independent formations during the battle and do not have to move around together. Additionally, support covens must belong to Chaos Undivided or the same faction as the coven associated with it. For example, if the army included one Khorne coven the army could include two Khorne Daemon Assault Engine formations or one Khorne Lord of Battles formation and one Undivided Defilers formation.

    In addition, formations may be given upgrades. Each type of upgrade can only be taken once by a formation. Upgrades are added to the formation and are not a separate formation. Each upgrade that is taken adds to the cost of the formation, as shown on the upgrade chart. The Nurgle Plague Tower is a special upgrade that may only be taken if the formation belongs to Nurgle, and, if taken, counts as one of the two support coven choices for the coven.

    Finally, each Slaves to Darkness Chaos Cultist army may field up to two Plague Zombie Infestations and contain a Daemon Pool.
