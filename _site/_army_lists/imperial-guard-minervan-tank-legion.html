using_the_army_list:

    The following army list allows you to field an Imperial Guard army that is based on an Minervan Tank Legion regiment. It can also be used as a <q>stand in</q> army list for other armoured Imperial Guard regiments, such as the Dniepr Tank Corps, Konig Armoured or Teutonian Heavy Tank, among many others.

    Minervan Tank Legion formations come in two types: _companies_ and _support formations_. Each company you include in the army allows you to field any two support formations. Although you can only take a support formation if you first take a company, they are treated as separate independent formations during a battle and do not have to move around together.

    In addition, companies may be given up to three company upgrades. Each type of upgrade can only be taken once by a company. Upgrades are added to the company and are not a separate formation. Support formations may not be given company upgrades. Each upgrade that is taken adds to the cost of the company, as shown on the upgrade chart. Note that you may take any type of upgrade for any type of company.

    Tank companies, platoons and squadrons may be comprised of different Leman Russ variants. The number of variants, along with the maximum number of rare variants, is listed in the <q>units</q> column. The variants themselves are listed in the Leman Russ variant and Leman Russ rare variant charts. Each variant taken adds to the cost of the formation or upgrade.

    Minervan Tank Legion Imperial Guard armies may be supported by Imperial Navy aircraft and Titan Legion battlegroups. A maximum of up to a third of the points available to the army may be spent on these formations.
