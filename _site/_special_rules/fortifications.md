name: Fortifications
---
Fortifications must be set up after objectives but before spacecraft and garrisons. The only exception to this are fortifications that come with a formation (i.e. they are part of that formation's <q>units</q>). These fortifications are set up with the formation they are part of and once set up cease to be <q>units</q> in that formation.

Fortifications may be set up anywhere a vehicle may normally be placed but may not be transported. They count as having a move of zero and may be set up on the table as <q>garrisons</q>. When setting up fortifications with multiple parts (or fortifications that come with a formation) they must be set up as a legal formation (see [Formations](/tournament-pack/#formations-1)).

Once set up, fortifications may be used by any unit (including enemy units).
