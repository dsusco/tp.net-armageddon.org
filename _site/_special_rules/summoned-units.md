Each formation in an army of chaos belongs to a faction that owes allegiance to one of the gods of chaos (Khorne, Nurgle, Slaanesh or Tzeentch), or to Chaos Undivided. You must decide which faction each formation in your army belongs to before the battle and note it down on your army list. Formations that purchase the Daemonic Pact upgrade are able to summon daemons to the battlefield.

Daemons in the Daemon Pool are purchased and noted only as being lesser or greater daemons, not by their faction. The summoning formation’s faction dictates what types of daemons may be summoned (see below). Players should either write down the contents of their Daemon Pool or use tokens to indicate the number of each lesser and greater daemon they have available to summon during a game. The Chaos player’s opponent is always able to view the number of lesser and greater daemons remaining in the Daemon Pool. The Daemon Pool is kept off the board and daemons are removed from it as formations summon daemons onto the board.

At the start of that formation’s action, before the action test dice roll is made, the formation may summon daemonic units from the Daemon Pool. Summoning allows you to call 2D3 summoning points worth of daemonic units to the battlefield (the number of summoning points it costs to summon a unit are listed below in parentheses after each unit). Summoning points must be used to summon daemonic units from the Daemon Pool and summoned units are brought into play immediately. If for any reason any summoning points generated are not used, they are lost and may not be carried over into subsequent turns. You may only summon as many daemons as you have left in your Daemon Pool. Left over daemonic units may be summoned during a later turn. Daemonic units that are destroyed are removed from play and are not put back into the Daemon Pool. Broken formations or formations that have not bought a Daemonic Pact may not summon daemons.

Players may only have one greater daemon of a given faction in the army on the board at one time. For example, if you already have a summoned Bloodthirster on the board you are not allowed to summon another Bloodthirster until that first greater daemon has been removed from play. Summoned units must be set up with their base within 5cm of any non-daemonic unit from their formation, (i.e. you cannot place a <q>chain</q> of summoned units). They may not be set up in the Zone of Control of an enemy unit or in impassable terrain. The type of unit that can be summoned depends on the summoning formation’s faction, as follows:

Summoned units count as part of the formation for all rules purposes as long as they remain on the battlefield. Summoned units are Expendable, but they are otherwise counted as normal units, and are included when working out if a formation outnumbers an opponent in an assault or is broken by Blast markers, etc. Note that Daemons that are killed in an assault do count towards the number of units killed by the enemy when working out modifiers for assault resolution. If a formation loses an assault (see [Loser Withdraws](/tournament-pack/#loser-withdraws)) remove extra hits from the formation before it is broken and all the remaining summoned units are then removed.

Summoned units remain on the battlefield until the end phase of the turn in which they are summoned. In the end of the rally phase, after formations have attempted to rally, all summoned units in the formation are removed from the board and placed back into the Daemon Pool unless the formation has a unit with Daemonic Focus (see [Daemonic Focus](#daemonic-focus)). Greater Daemons that are returned to the Daemon Pool keep the same DC they had when they left the battlefield. They do not heal back to full DC, so when summoned again they will have that same DC. Summoned units that are destroyed are not put back into the Daemon Pool. Note that this may lead to the formation breaking if the number of Blast markers on the formation is greater than the number of units left in play after the summoned units have been removed. When a formation breaks any summoned units in the formation are lost in the warp and considered destroyed. They do not go back into the Daemon Pool.
