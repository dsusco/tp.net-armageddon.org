The Dark Eldar are piratical raiders from the depths of the Dark City and the treacherous expanses of space. Due to their limited population, losses simply cannot be sustained at length. Because of this they have developed tactics that when combined with their highly advanced technology allows them to attack the enemy and then quickly retire in order to avoid any return fire. This ability is reflected by the following special rules, which apply to all formations in a Dark Eldar army:

Dark Eldar formations that take advance or double actions may choose to shoot either before or after each move. However, they may still only shoot once during the action. For example, a Dark Eldar formation taking an advance action could shoot and then move or move and then shoot, while a formation taking a double action could shoot and move twice, move twice and then shoot, or move then shoot and then move again.

In addition, a Dark Eldar formation that wins an assault is allowed to move up to their full movement when they consolidate, rather than being limited to a move of 5cm as would normally be the case.
