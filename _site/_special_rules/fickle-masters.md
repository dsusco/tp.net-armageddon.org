The Chaos Powers are quick to punish or reward their champions. In the strategy phase if the Chaos player rolls a 6 they are rewarded for their tactical acumen with an additional 1D3 lesser daemons to add to the Daemon Pool (see [Summoned Units](#summoned-units)). If the Chaos player rolls 1 their patron Powers withdraw their support and the Chaos player must remove D3 lesser daemons from the Daemon Pool. If the Chaos player has no remaining daemons in their Daemon Pool then there is no further effect.
