The Kashnarak is a massive, enraged animal that squeezes through a Webway portal and is set loose on the battlefield at the beginning of any turn the Dark Eldar desire (before strategy roll) and acts as a <q>third</q> player. It will always attempt a barging, close combat assault on the closest formation(s), even Dark Eldar formations! If unable to reach base-to-base contact, the beast will march toward the closest formation, to its maximum movement. If it reaches an enemy zone of control, the beast stops its move. Consolidation moves are also toward the closest formation. From then on, it is the first activation of subsequent turns, before the strategy roll or teleport, following the model above. A broken Kashnarak will remain in place on the board and will not attempt a move until it rallies.

The exceptions are when in the presence of a Wych unit. If within 15cm of a Wych unit at the beginning of the Kashnarak activation (see above), its assault or move may be directed by the Dark Eldar player. This includes a Wych unit within 15cm of the Kashnarakâ€™s Webway portal. In addition, the Kashnarak will never move toward or assault a Wych formation; instead it will choose the next closest formation. These directed actions still take place prior to the strategy roll for the turn.

Regardless of its actions, the Kashnarak is not considered part of the Dark Eldar force for the purposes of placing formations, holding objectives, calculating crossfire, or determining victory conditions and tie-breaker calculations. It neither counts toward Dark Eldar activations nor does it count toward Webway Portal use. It does not benefit from Hit &amp; Run tactics. The Kashnarak can contest objectives for both the Dark Eldar (except when within 15cm of a Wych unit) and their opponents.
