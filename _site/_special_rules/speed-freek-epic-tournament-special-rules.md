name: "Speed Freek Epic Tournament Special Rules"

Every Speed Freek Ork army _must_ include a Mekboy Bad Ork Bikerboy unit. The unit is free, you don’t have to pay any points for him, and it can be added to any formation in the army.

Every unit in a Speed Freek army must either have a speed of 30cms plus, or be transported in a unit with a speed of 30cm plus. In other words, formations may not include units with a speed of less than 30cm unless they also have a transport vehicle capable of carrying the unit around.

Burning Death Speed Freek armies are allowed to field a Warbike Outriders formation. All units in the formation have _scout_.
