name: Speed Freek Epic Tournament Special Rules

Every Speed Freek Ork army _must_ include a Mekboy Bad Ork Bikerboy unit. The unit is free, you donâ€™t have to pay any points for him, and it can be added to any formation in the army.

Every unit in a Speed Freek army must either have a speed of 30cms plus, or be transported in a unit with a speed of 30cm plus. In other words, formations may not include units with a speed of less than 30cm unless they also have a transport vehicle capable of carrying the unit around.

Burning Death Speed Freek armies are allowed to field a Warbike Outriders formation. All units in the formation have _scout_.
