name: Hit &amp; Run Tactics

The Eldar are a dying race, and any loss is deeply mourned. Because of this they have developed tactics that, when combined with their highly advanced technology, allows them to attack the enemy and then quickly retire in order to avoid any return fire. This special ability is reflected by the following special rules, which apply to all formations in an Eldar army.

Eldar formations that take advance or double actions may choose to shoot either before or after each move. However, they may still only shoot once during the action. For example, an Eldar formation taking an advance action could shoot and then move or move and then shoot, while a formation taking a double action could shoot and move twice, move twice and then shoot, or move then shoot and then move again.

In addition Eldar formations that wins an assault are allowed to move any distance up to their speed value when they consolidate, rather than being limited to a move of 5cm as would normally be the case.
