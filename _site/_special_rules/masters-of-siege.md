The Imperial Fists have a special expertise in siege warfare and mass shock assaults. This is represented by the following rules:

* An Imperial Fists army may start one additional garrison formation on overwatch for every full 1,000 points its point total is greater than 2,000.
* All units count as having _walker_ when making a dangerous terrain test for entering or starting to move on minefields that have been purchased as part of the army.
* All infantry units gain _first strike_ when within trenches purchased as part of the army.
* All infantry units gain a 4+ cover save when within bunkers purchased as part of the army. They may take this cover save against a _macro-weapon_ hit. In addition, they may re-roll a failed cover save against any non-macro-weapon hit. Weapons with _ignore cover_ negate this cover save as normal.
