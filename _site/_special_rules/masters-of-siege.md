The Imperial Fists have a special expertise in siege warfare and mass shock assaults. This is represented by the following rules:

* An Imperial Fists army may start three garrisoned formations on overwatch instead of two.
* All units count as having _walker_ when making a dangerous terrain test for entering or starting to move on minefields that have been purchased as part of the army.
* All infantry units gain _first strike_ when within trenches purchased as part of the army.
* All infantry units gain a 4+ save with _reinforced armour_. This replaces both their regular save and the 3+ bunker cover save. This save is lost if the unit suffers an _ignore cover_ hit.
