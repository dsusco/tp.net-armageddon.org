name: Deathwatch Transports
---
The Deathwatch is a highly mobile army. Because of this, the points cost of certain formations includes enough Rhino transport vehicles to transport it and any upgrades that have been taken. Determine the number of Rhinos needed after all upgrades have been purchased. The number of Rhinos will always be the minimum needed to carry the formation, you can’t take extras along to cover the loss of other transports.

Note that many formations don’t receive Rhinos, usually because they can’t fit into them. Formations that come with Rhinos will be noted as having <q>plus transport</q> in the units section of the army list opposite. Also note that you don’t have to take Rhinos if you don’t want to. If you’d rather field the formation on foot instead, so it can act as a garrison for example, or be transported in a Thunderhawk Gunship, then you may do so.

You may choose to replace a formation’s Rhinos with Drop Pods before each game, after the opposing army is known but before objectives are placed. Formations making a planetfall via Drop Pods (or by another unit with that ability) may be upgraded with Corvus Blackstars, these are assumed to make planetfall alongside the infantry and do not need to be transported by Drop Pods.
