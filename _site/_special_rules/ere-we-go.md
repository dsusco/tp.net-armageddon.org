name: "'Ere We Go!"
---
Before passing an action test a Gargant, Great Gargant or Mega Gargant formation may declare that it is using _'Ere We Go!_. Formations using _'Ere We Go!_ increase the Speed value of all their War Engine units by +5cm until the conclusion of their action. However, for each move of the action each War Engine unit suffers its critical hit effect. For example, if a Great Gargant formation carries out a double action then the Great Gargant unit catches fire twice and resolves the effects of those fires in the end phase. Whether a unit moves 0cm or less than its increased Speed value does not matter, it is still considered a move for the purposes of this rule.
