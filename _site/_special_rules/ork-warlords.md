Every Ork army <em>must</em> include a Supreme Command character called a Warlord. The Warlord character is free, you don’t have to pay any points for it. If the army includes any Great Gargants, then the Warlord must be placed in one of them. If there are no Great Gargants in the army then the Warlord will join a Nobz or a Gargant unit.
