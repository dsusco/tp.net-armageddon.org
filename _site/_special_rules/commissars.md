<p>An Imperial Guard army may include one Commissar character per 500 points, or part thereof, in the army. The Commissars do not cost any points.</p>

<p>Commissar units may be added to the army at the start of the battle before either side sets up. If the army includes a Supreme Commander than the first Commissar must be attached to the Supreme Commander&rsquo;s formation. Any further Commissars may be attached to any other formations.</p>

<p>You may not include more than one Commissar per formation. You may not add a Commissar to an Imperial Ally formation. If you have more Commissars than formations any excess is lost.</p>
