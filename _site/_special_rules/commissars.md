An Imperial Guard army may include one Commissar character per 500 points, or part thereof, in the army. The Commissars do not cost any points.

Commissar units may be added to the army at the start of the battle before either side sets up. If the army includes a Supreme Commander than the first Commissar must be attached to the Supreme Commander&rsquo;s formation. Any further Commissars may be attached to any other formations.

You may not include more than one Commissar per formation. You may not add a Commissar to an Imperial Ally formation. If you have more Commissars than formations any excess is lost.
