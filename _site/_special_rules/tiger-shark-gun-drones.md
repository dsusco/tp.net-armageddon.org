Tiger Shark Squadrons may be given a Gun Drone formation to transport. Transported Gun Drone formations may be split across multiple Tiger Sharks as an exception to the normal aircraft transport rules. The Tiger Sharks cannot land, make an engagement, or embark units, but can disembark transported Gun Drones after an approach move. The Gun Drone formation may shoot when it disembarks as normal (see [Transporting Ground Units](#transporting-ground-units)), and counts as having activated for that turn. After this initial deployment the Gun Drones are a completely independent formation. Gun Drones being transported by Tiger Sharks do not generate blast markers for being destroyed until after they are disembarked.
