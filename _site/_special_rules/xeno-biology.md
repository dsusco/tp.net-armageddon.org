The biology of Tyranids gives them certain benefits on the field of battle which are represented by the following rules:

Brood Nest
: Each Brood Nest included in the army allows the Tyranid player to pick up to three formations to be kept off-board, in reserve, and enter play through a Brood Nest. These formations may enter play by taking an action that allows them to make a move, and then measuring their first move from a point on a Brood Nest declared at the start of the game. No more than one formation may enter play through each Brood Nest each turn.
: If the entry point on a Brood Nest is in the zone of control of enemy units a formation may only enter play via an engage action and must move into base contact with all enemy units that have the entry point in their zone of control. Once these enemy units are contacted and lose their zone of control any remaining units that are entering play may use their charge move without this additional restriction.
: If a formation fails the action test that would bring it on to the board, it must use the hold action to move on to the board if it is able. If this is not possible due to the entry point being in an enemy unit's zone of control then the formation takes a Blast marker and loses its action.
: In the Epic tournament game rules formations in reserve with multiple deployment options (e.g. Brood Nest, teleport, tunneler) must be declared at the start of the game to be entering play only via one of these options.

Mobility
: Tyranid armored vehicle and war engine units do not take dangerous terrain tests. In addition, Tyranid light vehicle units count as infantry for the purposes of terrain (see [Terrain](/tournament-pack/#terrain)). Fortified positions such as minefields or razorwire, and special terrain features such as lava flows affect Tyranids normally.

Regeneration
: War engine units with _regeneration_ can regain lost damage capacity points. Each unit with regeneration regains one damage capacity point at the beginning of each turn’s end phase. Regeneration cannot be used by a destroyed unit nor may it increase a unit’s damage capacity beyond the starting amount.
