Orks are not noted for their organisational abilities, and thus usually have a pretty low initiative rating. However, if there is one thing that will galvanise an Ork warband, it&rsquo;s the thought of a good punch-up! Because of this, Ork formations that are attempting to take engage or double actions receive a +2 modifier to their action test roll. Ork flyboyz similarly relish the chance to shoot things up, and receive a +2 modifier to their action test roll when attempting to carry out interception or ground attack actions (see [Aircraft](/tournament-pack/#aircraft)).
