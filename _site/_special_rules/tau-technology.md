Deflector Shield
: Tau deflector shields work like an invulnerable save in all respects, except that this invulnerable save is always at 5+.

Guided Missiles
: Guided missiles may only be fired at a target formation that is <q>marked</q>, but guided missiles may be fired without line of fire if the target is marked.

Markerlights
: All enemy formations with at least one unit within 30cm range and line of fire (Line of Fire) of at least one Tau unit with the markerlights ability is considered to be <q>marked</q>. When shooting at a marked formation, all ranged firepower attacks add +1 to their to-hit roll. This bonus for shooting at a marked enemy may not be used when making Anti-Aircraft attacks.  A Tau formation that is broken or marched this turn may not mark an enemy formation.

Tau Jet Packs
: Tau jet packs follow all the rules for Jump Packs. Additionally, units with Tau jet packs are allowed to make an additional move of 10cm at the end of an advance, double or march order. The extra move is allowed whether or not the unit fires and takes place after any firing. This extra move may be in any direction and follows all the normal movement rules, so unit coherency and zones of control must be adhered to as usual. No extra movement is allowed on any orders other than advance, double or march.
: In formations where only some of the units have Tau jet packs, the units without Tau jet packs are not allowed the extra move.
