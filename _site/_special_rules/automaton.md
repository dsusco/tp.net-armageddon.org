name: Automaton
---
A formation does not receive a Blast marker when a unit with automaton is destroyed, this includes the extra Blast marker from the first casualty of a crossfire and for units destroyed for being out of formation after a move. Automaton units hit by a weapon with disrupt <strong>do</strong> take a Blast marker however.

If a hit is inflicted on an automaton unit because it is in a broken formation which is receiving a Blast marker (see [_Blast Markers and Broken Formations_](/tournament-pack/#blast-markers-and-broken-formations)) then it may attempt to save normally.

Automaton units killed in an assault count for the purposes of working out its result (see [_Work Out Result_](/tournament-pack/#work-out-result)).
