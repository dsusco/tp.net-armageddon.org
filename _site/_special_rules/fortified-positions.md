name: Fortified Positions
---
Fortified positions must be set up after objectives have been placed but before spacecraft and garrisons are set up. The only exception to this are fortified positions that are listed as part of a formation's <q>units</q>. While they are not actually units, they are set up with the formation they are part of.

Fortified positions may be set up anywhere a vehicle may deploy on the player's half of the table. They may not be transported. Each group of fortified positions (whether part of a formation or not) must be set up so every piece is within 5cm of another piece from the same group, and so all pieces from the same group form a <q>chain</q> without any gaps of more than 5cm. Additionally, if a group of fortified positions is part of a formation then at least one piece must be within 5cm of a unit from the formation when they are set up.

Once set up, fortified positions may be used by any unit (including enemy units).
