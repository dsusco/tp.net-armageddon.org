Every Ork army _must_ include a Supreme Command character called a Warlord. The Warlord character is free, you don&rsquo;t have to pay any points for it. The Warlord will join the formation with the most units in the army. War Engines count their starting Damage Capacity towards the formation size. If there is a tie you may choose which warband the Warlord will join.

Orkeosaurus that are part of a warband may only transport units from their own formation.

Feral Ork armies are allowed to field a Trappa formation. This formation represents Ork Wildboyz using their skills to scout ahead of the main army. Because of this all units in the formation have _scout_.
