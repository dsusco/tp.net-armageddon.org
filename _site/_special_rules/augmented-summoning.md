Some chaos units are noted as having _Augmented Summoning (+x)_. Units with this ability add a number of summoning points equal to <q>x</q> when the formation they are in summons daemons (see [_Summoned Units_](#summoned-units)). For example, a unit noted as having Augmented Summoning (+2D3) would allow a formation with a Daemonic Pact to roll 4D3 for summoning points as opposed to the usual 2D3.
