The Necron are an offensive army, always on the advance, stopping only to eliminate enemy positions before moving on to harvest others. While subject to disruption from losses and enemy fire, the mechanical nature of the Necron permits them to easily reorganize to maintain the offensive momentum. Necron formations receive a +1 bonus to Marshal actions. Due to their steady, deliberate, nature Necron formations cannot take a March action.
