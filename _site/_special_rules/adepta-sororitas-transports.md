name: Adepta Sororitas Transports
---
The Adepta Sororitas are a highly mobile army. Because of this, the points cost of certain formations includes enough Rhino transport vehicles to transport it and any upgrades that have been taken. Determine the number of Rhinos needed after all upgrades have been purchased. The number of Rhinos will always be the minimum needed to carry the formation, you can’t take extras along to cover the loss of other transports.

Note that many formations don’t receive Rhinos, usually because they can’t fit into them. Formations that come with Rhinos will be noted as having <q>plus transport</q> in the units section of the army list opposite. Also note that with the exception of Dominion formations you don’t have to take Rhinos if you don’t want to, Dominion formations must always be transported in Immolators, Repressors or Rhinos. If you’d rather field the formation on foot instead, so it can act as a garrison for example, then you may do so.
