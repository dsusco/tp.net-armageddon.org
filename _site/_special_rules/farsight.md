Eldar Farseers are able to partially unravel the threads of time, allowing them to foresee events that may affect his army, and act to counter them. To represent this, any Eldar formation that includes a unit with Farsight may ignore the -1 Action test penalty when they try to retain the initiative.

In addition, once per turn the Eldar player may attempt to retain the initiative twice in a row (i.e. the Eldar player can retain the initiative and take another action after having successfully retained the initiative once already). Any Eldar formation may be chosen, including those that do not include a unit with Farsight, but at least one unit with Farsight must still be in play and on the battlefield. The formation must still pass an initiative test in order to carry out the action, and will suffer the -1 modifier for retaining the initiative unless it includes a unit with Farsight. Once the action has been taken the initiative returns to the opposing player.
