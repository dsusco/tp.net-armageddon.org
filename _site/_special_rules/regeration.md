War engine units with Regeneration can regain lost damage capacity points. Each unit with regeneration regains one damage capacity point at the beginning of each turn’s end phase.

Regeneration cannot be used by a destroyed unit nor may it increase a unit’s damage capacity beyond the starting amount.
