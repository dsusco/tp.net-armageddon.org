name: Automata

Formations that are comprised completely of units with _automata_ may only carry out marshal, overwatch and sustained fire actions. They also cannot capture objectives in the Epic tournament game rules.

Formations that include at least one unit **without** automata do not receive a Blast marker when a unit with automata is destroyed, this includes the extra Blast marker from the first casualty of a crossfire and for units destroyed for being out of formation after a move. Also, if an automata unit is hit by a weapon with disrupt it does not inflict a Blast marker. Finally, donâ€™t count units with automata that are lost in an assault when working out who has won the combat.
