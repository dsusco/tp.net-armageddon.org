Necron
: Necron technology allows many of its units to repair themselves at an accelerated rate. This is reflected as the Necron ability in a unit&rsquo;s datasheet.
: Units with _Necron_ that have been destroyed can regenerate. Formations can return one previously destroyed Necron unit in the end phase of each turn either on or off the board. In addition, if a formation regroups on board it can use the dice rolls to either return units with the Necron ability to play or to remove blast markers or both (e.g., if you rolled a <q>2</q> you could return 2 units to play, remove 2 blast markers, or return 1 unit and remove 1 blast marker). Formations off board are restricted to using their regroup function to remove blast markers only.

Portal
: Necron Portals are the primary means by which the Necron forces are transported across the galaxy. Any formation that is in the reserves, either because it has not entered play or has left the board for any reason, may enter play via a _portal_ as part of any activation that allows movement. Measure their movement using the portal as the starting point. Additionally, formations may leave the board by entering a portal, taking them into the reserves. Note that once in the reserves they can either re-enter play immediately via another portal, provided they have movement, or remain in the reserves.
: Necron Portals can only be used by armoured vehicles with _walker_, infantry, or light vehicles units. Each portal can be used only once per turn for either entering or exiting the battlefield, not for both. Thus a formation may enter one portal with part of their movement, and exit from a second, unused portal, continuing their movement from that portal.
: If, at the end of the movement, a unit is out of formation it is destroyed (see [Formations](/tournament-pack/#formations-1)). Example: if you moved a formation of four units through one portal and out another and two units were unable to make the full movement (i.e. get through the second portal), the Necron player would have to choose which units were to be destroyed, the two that moved through the portal or the two that didn&rsquo;t.

Living Metal
: Units made of _living metal_ receive a _reinforced armor_ saving throw against normal weapons, or weapons with _lance_ or _macro-weapon_. In addition, their save is not reduced by _sniper_. Any titan killer attacks are automatically reduced to _titan killer (1)_ when resolving hits against units with living metal, and living metal units are permitted a single armor save.
