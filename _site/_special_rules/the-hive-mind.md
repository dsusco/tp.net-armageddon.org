The Hive Mind of the Tyranids is a single coordinating sentience. Its influence is projected through synapse creatures that communicate with their lesser kin via a form of telepathy. Under the control of synapse creatures the slave organisms act in perfect unison. However, should the synapse creatures be slain the basic creatures revert to their animalistic behaviors until other synapse creatures can exert control over them. This is represented by the following rules for synapse swarm, **not independent swarm or war engine**, formations:

* Synapse swarms ignore brood units for the purposes of determining formation strength during tiebreak.
* A synapse swarm with no synapse units has an initiative of 3+ and may not capture objectives.
* A synapse swarm with at least one synapse unit ignores the -2 modifier for being broken when it is attempting to rally. Additionally, it can absorb other synapse swarm formations with no synapse units at the end of its action. The formation must have one unit within 5cm of a unit from the formation(s) being absorbed. The units and blast markers of an absorbed formation become part of the formation. An absorbed formation is considered completely destroyed for the purposes of tiebreak and the _Break Their Spirit_ goal.
