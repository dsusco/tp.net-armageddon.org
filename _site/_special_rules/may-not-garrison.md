name: May Not Garrison

The Eldar are a highly mobile army, and rarely have enough forces to try to take and hold ground. Because of this, instead of maintaining a heavily garrisoned front line, they will usually rely on a screen of Rangers and War Walkers to warn of the approach of any enemy forces. Meanwhile the bulk of the highly mobile Eldar army will be held back in reserve, where it will be ready to move quickly to any threatened sector. This tactic allows the Eldar to hold large areas of ground with relatively few troops.

To represent these tactics, only Eldar Rangers and War Walkers are allowed to garrison objectives in the Epic tournament game scenario.
