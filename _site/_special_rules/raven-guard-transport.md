name: "Raven Guard Transport"
---
The Raven Guard are a highly mobile army. Because of this, the points cost of certain formations includes enough Rhino transport vehicles to transport it and any upgrades that have been taken. Determine the number of Rhinos needed after all upgrades have been purchased. The number of Rhinos will always be the minimum needed to carry the formation, you can’t take extras along to cover any losses.

Formations that come with Rhinos will be noted as having <q>plus transport</q> in the units section of the army list. Raven Guard formations must take the transport vehicles, you cannot leave them behind in order to garrison the formation. You can only choose to ignore this if the formation is entering play via a special rule (e.g. planetfall or teleport) or an aircraft.

You may choose to replace a formation’s Rhinos with Drop Pods before each game, after the opposing army is known but before objectives are placed.
