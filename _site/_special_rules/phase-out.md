name: Phase Out
---
When a Necron formation becomes broken, it does not just fall back, but also vanishes from the battlefield without leaving any proof of its existence.

In the end phase of the turn, remove the formation from the board into the reserves, but keep it away from any destroyed units. The formation will roll to rally in the end phase, handling blast markers as per the core rules. It may re-enter by teleporting, or through a portal. If there are not enough portals to deal with all the off-table formations, then the formation must remain off the table until a portal is available for it to use. If the rally roll fails, the formation must remain in the reserves until it rallies. Note that with the exception of the Câ€™tan, no Necron War Engines may phase out.
