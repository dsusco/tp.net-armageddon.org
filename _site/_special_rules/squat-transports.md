name: Squat Transports

Any formation with <q>plus transport</q> in its core units may include enough Rhinos to transport all infantry units in the formation if the player desires. The number of Rhinos will always be the minimum required to transport the entire formation and determined after all upgrades have been added. Alternatively, Termites may be substituted for all of the Rhinos. Finally, if Termites are taken, every five Termites may be replaced with a Mole if the player desires.
