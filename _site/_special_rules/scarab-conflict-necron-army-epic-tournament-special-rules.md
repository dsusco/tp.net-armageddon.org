Necron Reserves
: Any Necron formation may be held back <q>in reserve</q> (with the exception of the Aeonic Orb and Abattoir) if you are playing the Epic Tournament scenario. Note that formations that do not have _teleport_ will only be able to enter play through portals. Any Necron formation in the reserves for any reason (either because it has not yet entered play or it is broken) is considered destroyed for the purpose of tiebreak, or the <q>Break Their Spirit</q> goal.

Garrisons
: The Necron typically act in an offensive manner and as such, their formations may not garrison in the Epic Tournament scenario unless fielding a Tomb Complex. To represent that a tomb may contain active Necron, the player may choose to garrison up to two Infantry Phalanx formations at the Tomb Complex.
