Blood Claws are most eager to prove themselves in battle. All Blood Claw, Skyclaw and Swiftclaw formations that are attempting to take engage actions receive a +1 modifier to their action test roll. Additionally, they must always make their complete counter charge move (unless they reach base contact with an enemy unit before then) so long as they remain a legal formation.
