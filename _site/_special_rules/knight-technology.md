Knight Shield
: Units with a Knight Shield may make a saving throw on a 4+ when they are hit instead of using their armour value. No modifiers ever apply to this saving throw and it is unaffected by macro-weapon, lance and titan killer hits. However, each point of damage from a titan killer hit must be saved separately. If the unit has reinforced armour as well then it is allowed to re-roll a failed save using its armour value unless the hit was a macro-weapon, lance or titan killer. Finally, none of these benefits apply to units in a crossfire or to hits from supporting fire.

Power Lance and Shock Lance
: The Power Lance and Shock Lance may only be used if the unit's formation carried out an engage action.
