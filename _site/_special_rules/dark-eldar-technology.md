Webway Portals
: These smallish portals are used by the Dark Eldar as much as the Eldar. Allowing safe travel through the Warp, each Webway portal included in the army allows the Dark Eldar player to keep up to three formations back in Commorragh. Any of these reserve formations may enter play via a Webway portal by taking an action that allows them to move, then measuring its first move from the portal on the tabletop. No more than one formation may travel through a single portal each turn. Wraithgate use is limited to formations made up exclusively of infantry, light vehicles, and armored vehicles with the walker ability (The feared Kashnarak is the exception to the rule).

Shadowfields
: Dark Eldar war engines are shrouded in light absorbing energy fields which serve as a powerful defence against the massed guns of their cornered prey. Each shadowfield will absorb one successful hit before going down; no blast markers are caused for this hit (this includes firefight but not close combat). A war engine with at least one shadowfield remaining automatically regains an additional field at the end of the rally phase of each turn. If the shadowfields are completely knocked out, they will not return for the remainder of the game. The war engine can never have more shadowfields than originally allotted. In addition an active Shadowfield always counts as being in cover (apply -1 cover modifier). This has no effect on their engagements, however, either in close combat or firefight.
