Space Wolves prefer to fight up close to the enemy and therefore never back down when a friendly pack needs help during an engagement. Space Wolf units with _Commander_ can order up to three formations of troops to follow them when they make an assault, as long as all the formations have at least one unit within **10cm** of a unit from the commanderâ€™s formation.
