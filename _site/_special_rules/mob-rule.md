Orks believe that as long as there’s a bunch of them still fighting together (slightly more than they can count up to is ideal!) then there’s always a chance that they’ll prevail, no matter the odds. To represent this, Ork formations with more than five units (i.e., too many to count on the fingers of one hand), not including Gretchin or Big Gunz units, receive a +1 modifier to any rally rolls they make, and formations with more than 10 such units receive a +2 modifier. For the purposes of this rule war engine’s count each point of starting damage capacity as a unit.
