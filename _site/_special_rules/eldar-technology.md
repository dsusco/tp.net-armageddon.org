name: Eldar Technology

The Eldar are a technologically sophisticated race that make use of a number of devices that have capabilities far in advance of anything used by the other races in the galaxy. These technological advantages are represented in Epic by the following special rules:

Holofield
: Eldar Titans are protected by a Holofield that is projected from special wing-like structures on the Titan’s carapace. These fracture the image of the Titan making it appear as a swirling cloud of coloured motes to the naked eye, while at the same time disrupting any targeting devices attempting to lock onto the Titan. The overall result is to make the Titan a very hard target to hit! Holofields provide Titans with a special 3+ saving throw that can be taken instead of the Titan’s normal saving throw. This save may always be taken, even against hits in an assault or against Titan Killer or Macro-weapons attacks. Make a single saving against weapons with the Titan Killer ability, rather than a separate save for each point of damage. If a vehicle with a Holofield also has Reinforced Armour, then it is allowed to re-roll its saving throw unless hit by Lance, Macro-weapon or Titan Killer attacks, but the re-roll must be made using the units armour save rather than the Holofield save. No Blast markers are placed for hits that are saved by a Holofield.

Lance
: A Lance uses a highly concentrated beam of laser energy to destroy heavily armoured targets. A unit with Reinforced Armour that is hit by a Lance weapon is not allowed to re-roll its saving throw.

Webway Portal
: Webway portals are used by the Eldar to safely travel through the Warp. Each Webway Portal included in the army allows the Eldar player to pick up to three other formations, and keep them back on the Craftworld. Any formation’s that are kept on the Craftworld may enter play via the Webway Portal, by taking an action that allows them to make a move, and then measuring their first move from the position that a Webway Portal occupies on the tabletop. Note that the formation may appear through any Webway Portal, not just the one that was <q>used</q> to allow the formation to be kept off-board. No more than one formation may travel through each Webway Portal each turn.
: In the Epic Tournament Game Rules formations in reserve with multiple deployment options must have a designated deployment method during setup (e.g. Webway Portal, air transport or teleport).
