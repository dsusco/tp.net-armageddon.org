<p>The Space Marines are a highly mobile army. Because of this, the points cost of a detachment usually includes enough Rhino transport vehicles to transport it and any upgrades that have been taken. Determine the number of Rhinos needed after all upgrades have been purchased. The number of Rhinos will always be the minimum needed to carry the formation, you can&rsquo;t take extras along to cover any losses!</p>

<p>Note that many formations don&rsquo;t receive Rhinos, usually because they can&rsquo;t fit into them. Detachments that come with Rhinos will be noted as having <q>plus transport</q> in the units section of the army list opposite.</p>

<p>Also note that Terminators must take either Teleport or have Land Raiders. They may not start the game as foot infantry.</p>
