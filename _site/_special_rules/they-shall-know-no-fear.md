Space Marines are renowned for their tenacity and bravery. This is represented by the following rules:

* It takes 2 Blast markers to suppress a Space Marine unit or kill a unit in a broken formation (ignore any leftover Blast markers).
* Space Marine formations are only broken if they have 2 Blast markers per unit in the formation.
* Space Marines formations only count half their number of Blaster markers in assault resolution (rounding down&mdash;note that assault resolution will not receive +1 for having no Blast markers if the formation has 1 Blast marker before rounding down). Halve the number of extra hits suffered by a Space Marine formation that loses an assault, rounding down in favour of the Space Marines.
* When a broken Space Marine formation rallies, it receives a number of Blast markers equal to the number of units, rather than half this number. Space Marines with the Leader special ability remove 2 Blast markers instead of 1.
