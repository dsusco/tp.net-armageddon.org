Does a transported unit lose its zone of control?
: Yes.

Are transported units considered to be in specific transporting units of their formation?
: You can play it either way, just bring it up in the five minute warm up.

Can a transport unit pick up a unit that is in terrain that is dangerous to the transport unit?
: Yes, but if the unit being picked up was completely within the dangerous terrain then the transport would have to take a dangerous terrain test.

Can a transport unit pick up a unit that is in terrain that is impassable to the transport unit?
: Yes, but only if the unit being picked up is not completely within the impassable terrain.

When disembarking, are transported units placed completely within 5cm of the transport unit or just so one part of the transported unit is within 5cm of the transport unit.
: You can play it either way, just bring it up in the five minute warm up.

How do transported units that are immobile or which have a speed of 0cm disembark?
: As normal.

Where are transported units placed when the unit transporting them is destroyed?
: Where the unit transporting them was.

What happens to transported units when the unit transporting them is destroyed by: dangerous terrain, the result of an assault, or an additional hit from a Blast marker on a broken formation?
: They make their normal armour save or a 6+ cover save, the formation they are part of would not receive a Blast marker for any of these saves if they failed.

What happens to transported units when the unit transporting them is destroyed by ending its second withdrawal move within 15cm of the enemy?
: If they're broken and not _fearless_ they will be destroyed. Otherwise they make their normal armour save or a 6+ cover save.

If a transport is destroyed by a hit with a special ability does that carry over to the transported units?
: Yes, the transported units save is affected by the type of hit the transport is destroyed by. For example, an _ignore cover_ hit would prevent the transported units from making a 6+ cover save.
