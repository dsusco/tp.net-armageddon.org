If a formation comes with Rhinos, and can also take Land Raiders and Razorbacks via upgrades, how do you determine how many Rhinos the formation receives?
: Add any Land Raiders to a formation first. Next, add any number of Razorbacks to the formation, up to the number required to transport those units not being transported in Land Raiders. Finally, the formation receives Rhinos to transport those units not being transported in Land Raiders or Razorbacks.
