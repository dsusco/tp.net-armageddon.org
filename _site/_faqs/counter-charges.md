name: Counter Charges
---
When a unit uses its counter-charge is it towards the closest enemy unit in the attacking formation or just the closest enemy unit?
: The closest enemy unit. This could be a unit from another formation.

If the closest enemy unit is in contact with two defending units can a unit counter-charge the next closest instead?
: Yes.

What happens when the closest enemy unit cannot be reach due to impassable terrain or friendly units?
: The counter-charge would follow the shortest path to get to the closest enemy unit.

Can units counter-charge over friendly units?
: Follow the normal movement rules (see [Other Units](/tournament-pack/#other-units)) with respect to this.

Can units disembark from a unit that has already counter-charged?
: Yes, so long as the transport unit isn't in base contact with two enemy units.

Can a unit that disembarked other units still counter-charge?
: No, disembarking happens at the end of a move.

Can a formation that used its overwatch fire on the attacking formation still counter-charge?
: Yes.

After counter charges are made does the engaging formation need to have at least one unit with a line of fire to a unit in the target formation in order for the assault to take place?
: In the first round yes, as <q>all the normal charge move rules apply</q>. In subsequent rounds the assault is already taking place and its result must be determined.

What happens when an assault goes into a second round and no units are within 15cm of each other after both sides counter charge?
: Work out the result again.
