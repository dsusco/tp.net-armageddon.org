Can a war engine transporting a broken formation assault?
: Yes, but any broken formations being transported may not disembark and fight in the assault. If they are forced to disembark due to the war engine being destroyed then they are destroyed as well. Note that They do count as taking part in the assault, however, and affect the assault modifiers when working out the result.

Can a unit that disembarked from a war engine to fight in an assault use its consolidation move to get back into the war engine?
: Yes, but the war engine may not make a consolidation move.
