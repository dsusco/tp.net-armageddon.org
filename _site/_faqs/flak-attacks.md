name: Flak Attacks

Can units with weapons that don't have an AA value be suppressed when making a flak attack?
: Yes, and they only need to be within range as all ground units have a line of fire to flying aircraft.

Do to hit modifiers for a double, marshal or sustain action apply to flak attacks?
: No, the only modifier that does is the -1 to hit during the end phase if the unit's formation carried out any action that involved a move.

An aircraft makes its approach move and suffers flak attacks from one unit in a formation. As it makes its disengagement move it comes into range of an other unit from the same formation, may this unit flak attack the aircraft?
: Yes, each _unit_ may only shoot at an aircraft once per turn.
