name: Place Objective Markers
---
Can the player with the higher strategy rating choose to make their opponent place first?
: No.

How big can objective markers be?
: As big as you like, just remember that they're a marker and as such don't count as terrain or block a line of fire.

Where should measurements for capturing/contesting an objective be made from?
: This should be brought up during five minute warp up. For objectives placed on a table edge, most groups measure to the center of the area that touches the table edge, while all other objectives are measured from their center or a designated point.
