Can a formation on CAP choose to carry out an interception action in reaction to an enemy CAP interception?
: No.

What is the order of events with regards to aircraft/anti-aircraft/flak attacks, CAP and landing?
: 1. An aircraft formation activates and makes an approach move.
2. If the action taken was a ground attack an enemy aircraft formation on CAP may choose to carry out an interception action against it. If this occurs then the enemy aircraft formation makes an approach move and all flak attacks (from the aircraft formation, or friendly aircraft or ground units with an AA value that were in range and arc at any point during the enemy's approach move) are resolved against it. Before rolling any saving throws it may choose to jink.
3. All anti-aircraft and flak attacks (from enemy aircraft or ground units with an AA value that were in range and arc during the aircraft's approach move) are resolved against the aircraft formation. Before rolling any saving throws it may choose to jink if it doesn't have the Bomber manoeuvre class.
4. If the aircraft formation has a transport capacity and is carrying out a ground attack it may choose to land, at which point it becomes a ground unit. If any unit's disembark they and the aircraft formation may be subject overwatch.
5. The aircraft formation resolves its attacks or fights an assault if it decided to air assault.
