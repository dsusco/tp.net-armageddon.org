Are the extra hits the losing formation suffers only applied to units that were <q>directly involved</q>?
: No, the are applied to any units in the losing formation.

Do the extra hits the losing formation suffers require a line of fire?
: No.

Can the extra hits the losing formation suffers be allocated to units being transported in a _fearless_ transport?
: Yes.

How are the extra hits the losing formation suffers allocated to a formation with units being transported?
: Once one of these hits is allocated to a transport (or it is skipped over because it is _fearless_) all units it is transporting must be allocated a hit (while any remain) before moving on to the next closest unit. Any remaining units that were being transported (_fearless_ units, or those that weren't allocated a hit) would then make their normal armour save or a 6+ cover save if the transport was destroyed, the formation would not receive a Blast marker for any of these saves if they failed.

Are units lost due to overwatch fire on the attacking formation counted when working out the result?
: No.

Are units lost due to failed dangerous terrain tests counted when working out the result?
: No, they are not kills _you_ have inflicted.
