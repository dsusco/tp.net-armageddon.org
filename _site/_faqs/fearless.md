What happens when a broken fearless unit remains in base contact with an enemy unit after loosing assault?
: Nothing special. If the enemy unit does not consolidate out of its zone of control then see [Zones of Control](/tournament-pack/#zones-of-control). If the units remain in base contact then the opposing formation will automatically be drawn in to an assault on either formation.
