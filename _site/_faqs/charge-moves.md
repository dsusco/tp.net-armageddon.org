Can a war engines barge units out of the way with a counter charge?
: Yes.

Can a war engine barge one formation and assault another?
: No, a unit can't enter an enemy's zone of control unless it is assaulting the unit's formation.

Can a war engine barge a unit and then move away from other units to deny attacks?
: Yes, but only if the war engine doesn't enter the other units' zone of control. A war engine is still required to move into base contact with an enemy unit if it enters its zone of control.
