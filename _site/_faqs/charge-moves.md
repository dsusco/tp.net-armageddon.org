Can a war engines barge units out of the way with a counter charge?
: Yes.

Can a war engine barge one formation and assault another?
: No, a unit can't enter an enemy's zone of control unless it is assaulting the unit's formation.

Can a war engine barge a unit and then move away from other units to deny attacks?
: Yes, but only if the war engine doesn't enter the other units' zone of control. A war engine is still required to move into base contact with an enemy unit if it enters its zone of control.

How many units does a war engine making a charge move count as when moving into base contact with an enemy unit?
: One. A war engine may have a number of units equal to twice its starting damage capacity in base contact with it but it still only counts as one unit when it moves into base contact with another unit (i.e., a Baneblade with a DC of 3 could be contacted by up to six enemy Shadowswords).

Can a war engine counter charge if it has enemy units in base contact?
: Nothing in [War Engine Assaults](/tournament-pack/#war-engine-assaults) specifically overrides <q>Defending units that are not already in base contact with an enemy unit are allowed to counter charge,</q> from [Counter Charges](/tournament-pack/#counter-charges). However, War Engines are allowed to barge as part of their counter charge, so it should be brought up in the five minute warm up. A suggested compromise is to mirror how a war engine loses its zone of control: so long as the number of units in base contact with a war engine is less than its starting damage capacity it may counter charge.
