Can a unit that's making a charge move put an enemy unit in base contact if the enemy is in terrain that is dangerous to the charging unit?
: Yes, if part of the enemy unit is not in dangerous terrain the unit can be put in base contact there without taking a dangerous terrain test. If the enemy unit is completely within the dangerous terrain then the charging unit would have to take a dangerous terrain test.

Can a unit that's making a charge move put an enemy unit in base contact if the enemy is in terrain that is impassable to the charging unit?
: Yes, if part of the enemy unit is not in impassable terrain the unit can be put in base contact there. If the enemy unit is completely within the impassable terrain then no.

What happens to a charging unit that enters the zone of control of an enemy unit and it does not have enough movement to make it into base contact?
: The charging unit would move as much as possible towards the closest enemy unit. The intent of the rule is that you should not be able to charge through a zone of control to reach a unit further away but should always move towards the closest enemy unit even if you cannot make it into base contact.

Can a unit making a charge move claim the cover to hit modifier and receive a cover save against overwatch fire?
: Yes and yes.

After it makes a charge move does the engaging formation need to have at least one unit with a line of fire to a unit in the target formation in order for the assault to take place?
: Yes. While it is not specifically stated in the rules it is implied (<q>close enough that individual infantry are able to engage in the fight and make use of their small arms</q>) and required to resolve firefight attacks.
