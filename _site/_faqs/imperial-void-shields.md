name: Imperial Void Shields

Do void shields stop a point of damage caused by: a failed dangerous terrain test, the extra hits from the result of an assault, a Blast marker on a broken formation, or the unit ending its second withdrawal move within 15cm of the enemy?
: No.

How many void shields go down if a war engine is hit by a _Titan Killer_ weapon that causes multiple points of damage?
: One per each point of damage, with any left over being allocated to the unit.

Can a formation regroup to repair downed void shields if it has no Blast markers?
: Yes.

If a formation with multiple units with void shields regroups is the number of repaired void shields the same for each unit or shared between them?
: Shared between them, e.g. if you chose to repair two void shields, one unit could repair two void shields or two units could repair one void shield each.

Are void shields considered when determining how many hits a war engine should be allocated?
: No.
