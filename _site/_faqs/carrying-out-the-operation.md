What is the order of events with regards to a spacecraft's operation.
: 1. The spacecraft resolves all of its orbital bombardment and pin-point attacks, assuming an action test is passed.
2. Each formation entering play via _planetfall_ is resolved (placing and then scattering it, and then resolving any special abilities like those on a Space Marine Drop Pod). These can be in any order the player controlling the spacecraft desires.
3. Check to see if any formations that were subject to orbital bombardment, pin-point attacks or special abilities are broken.
