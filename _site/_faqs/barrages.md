Can a barrage claim a crossfire bonus?
: Yes.

If a unit is under multiple templates from the same barrage how many to hit rolls are rolled for it?
: One.

Do extra Barrage templates have to be placed to get as many enemy units from the target formation under them as possible?
: The rules are unclear here, but yes they do.

Can a Barrage template be placed over units that can't be seen? Or over units that are out of range?
: Yes, each weapon contributing to the barrage need only have a line of fire and range to a _single unit_ under the _first_ Barrage template. Extra Barrage templates do not require either condition, and an indirect fire barrage does not require a line of fire.

Can a Barrage template be placed completely out of range?
: Extra templates certainly can, and the first Barrage template can in certain circumstances (a unit that is partially in and partially out of range for instance). The Barrage template can be placed over any part of a unit (even if that part is out of range) so long as part of that unit is in range. A line of fire is still required to this unit, unless it is an indirect fire barrage.

How do you resolve hits for a Barrage template that's over some units in cover and some that aren't?
: Roll to hit separately for those units in cover, and for those units not in cover.

How do you resolve hits for a Barrage template that's over different kinds of units?
: Each unit under a template requires a separate to hit roll to see if it has been hit. For example, a barrage covering two Nobz (one with the Warlord), six Boyz (with two in cover), two Grotz, four Battlewagons and one Flakwagon would need to roll the following to hit rolls: one for the Nobz with the Warlord, one for the other Nobz, four for the Boyz out of cover, two for the Boyz in cover, two for the Grotz, four for the Battlewagons and one for the Flakwagon.
: The <q>type</q> referred to in the sentence about speed dice rolling refers to the kind of unit (Tactical, Assault, Devastator, etc.) not the unit type (INF, AV, etc.).

How are barrages where some barrage points have special abilities resolved?
: When firing in a barrage, a special weapon ability can only be used if all of the units firing have it. If a special ability is used in a barrage then those barrage weapons that don't have the special ability may not fire in the barrage, nor may they fire a separate barrage during their activation.
