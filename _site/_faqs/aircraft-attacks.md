name: Aircraft Attacks
---
Can an aircraft end its approach move in the middle of an enemy formation in order to ensure a specific target is allocated hits before other models?
: No, if an aircraft ends its approach move in this manner then assume the fire is coming from the direction of the approach move.

Do aircraft that attack ground formations suffer to hit modifiers for cover?
: Only if the target is in cover, if the target is obscured then no because aircraft ignore anything that might block line of sight.
