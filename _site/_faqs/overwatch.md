Can a formation on overwatch use its overwatch fire when it is not a legal formation?
: Yes, the requirement to be a legal formation is only when the formation is taking an overwatch action. However, it could not choose to remain on overwatch as it would have to move back into a legal formation.

Can a formation on overwatch use its overwatch fire when it is in the zone of control of an enemy formation.
: Yes, as it is not taking an action when shooting while on overwatch. However, it could not choose to remain on overwatch as it would have to charge the enemy or leave its zone of control.

A formation carries out an action that involves a move but none of the units physically move, is it still susceptible to overwatch?
: Yes. Any action that includes one of more moves (advance, engage, double, march and possibly marshal, hold and special actions) is considered a move for the purposes of overwatch, even if units moved 0cm.
: Note that withdrawals and consolidation moves are optional however, and that a player can choose not to move the formation at all, thus avoiding overwatch.

Do units that enter play via a special rule (landing, planetfall, self planetfall, teleporting, tunneling, being summoned or swarmed) trigger overwatch fire?
: No, only completing a move or disembarking triggers overwatch.

Does a counter charge move trigger overwatch fire?
: No.

What happens to formation that is broken from overwatch fire while it is carrying out an action?
: See [Withdrawals](/tournament-pack/#withdrawals), <q>it makes a withdrawal and loses the rest of its action.</q>
