name: Disengagement Moves
---
If an aircraft has traveled more than 30cm during its approach move and didn't end it with a turn can it turn immediately when it makes a disengagement move?
: No, it still must move at least another 30cm before it is allowed to turn.

What happens when a landed aircraft does not make a disengagement move?
: It rallies in the end phase like a ground formation and has the potential to activate like a ground formation next turn.
