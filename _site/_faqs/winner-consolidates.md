Can a transport unit pick up another unit as part of its consolidation move? What if the unit being picked up disembarked at the end of the charge move?
: Yes and yes, but the unit being picked up may not make a consolidation move when this happens (see [Transport Vehicles](/tournament-pack/#transport-vehicles)).

Do I have to use a consolidation move to move out of an enemy's zone of control?
: No. A consolidation move isn't mandatory, it just can't be used to enter another enemy unit's zone of control.
: Note that this can create the situation where a _fearless_ unit does not withdraw and units from the winning side remain in base contact with it. When this happens the opposing formation will automatically be drawn in to an assault on either formation.
