How many units can claim cover from a fortification?
: If this isn't covered by special rules or the scenario then it should be brought up in the five minute warm up.

Can a speed 0cm unit on a road claim the +5cm move bonus?
: There is no clear distinction in the rules between speed 0cm and immobile units. We recommend you go over it with your opponent during the 5 minute warm-up.
: A speed 0cm unit could possibly benefit from the road movement bonus, allowing it to move 5cm per move. However, it may obviously not leave the road as it would then lose its bonus movement. A unit with a speed of <q>immobile</q> may not move, even on a road.

Can units making a counter charge move on a road claim the +5cm move bonus?
: No, the <q>moves</q> referenced here are those in actions. A counter charge move is not one of those moves.

How many infantry can be counted as being in cover when touching an armoured vehicle or war engine?
: There is no limit as per the written rules, so long as the infantry bases can touch the AV or WE. However, a limit of 2 per AV (2 per starting DC of a WE) is an extremely common house rule. Enough so that it should be brought up in the five minute warm up.

Can an infantry unit claim cover from enemy armoured vehicles?
: Yes.

*[AV]: Armoured Vehicle
*[WE]: War Engine
