name: The Five Minute Warm Up
---
Is there a complete list of what to cover in the five minute warm up?
: * Should you dice for each ability used at the start of the turn?
* Are transported units considered to be in specific transporting units of their formation?
* When disembarking, are transported units placed completely within 5cm of the transport unit or just so one part of the transported unit is within 5cm of the transport unit?
* When does a unit count as being in cover?
* How many units can claim cover from a armoured vehicle, war engine, or terrain feature?
* Does the charging formation need to get within 15cm of the original target or can it get within 15cm of any intermingled formation?
* How are attacks with special abilities like ignore cover and lance allocated in an assault?
* Can a war engine counter charge if it has enemy units in base contact?
* Is it possible to air assault into a formation which is completely covered by the zone of control of another formation?
* Where should measurements for capturing/contesting an objective be made from?
* What house rules do you normally play with?
* Are you using the <q>counts as</q> rule?
* What is your army capable of (units, weapons and special rules)?
