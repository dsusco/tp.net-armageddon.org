Do formations that are <q>off board</q> (spacecraft) or in reserve count towards the Break Their Spirit goal?
: No. However, a formation that enters play and is destroyed (e.g. an aircraft) would count towards the goal.

Does a whole formation have to be on the opponent's half of the table to deny the They Shall Not Pass goal? A whole unit?
: One part of a single unit on the opponent's half of the table is all that it takes to deny them the They Shall Not Pass goal.

If a formation rallies in the end phase can it deny the opponent the They Shall Not Pass goal?
: Yes.
