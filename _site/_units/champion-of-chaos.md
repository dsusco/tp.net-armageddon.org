    A Champion of Chaos added to a formation that belongs to Khorne, Nurgle or Chaos Undivided has a Daemon Artifact weapon. A Champion of Chaos added to a formation that belongs to Slaanesh or Tzeentch has a Daemon Bolt weapon. A unit with this character may be sacrificed (removed from play without its formation receiving a Blast marker) before rolling for summoning points. This changes its Augmented Summoning from (+2D3) to (+6), and a Greater Daemon must be summoned. Place the Greater Daemon within 10cm of the point where the sacrificed unit was removed.
