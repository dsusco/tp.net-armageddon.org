notes:
  |
    May transport ten infantry units without _Jump Packs_ or _Mounted_. Armed with any eight of the following: Barrage Missile, Deathstrike Missile, Vortex Missile or Warp Missile. Only one missile may be fired per turn. Warp Missiles ignore _Imperial Void Shields_ and _Power Fields_. The unit's fire control center allows it to re-roll one failed to-hit roll per turn. May step over units and pieces of terrain that that are lower lower than the unit’s knees and less than 2cm wide. Critical Hit Effect: The unit’s plasma reactor has been breached. Roll a D6 for each breach on the unit in the end phase of each turn. On a roll of 1 the unit is destroyed and all units within 5cm suffer a hit on a roll of 4+, and on a roll of 4–6 the breach has been repaired. Any breach not repaired causes one point of damage.
