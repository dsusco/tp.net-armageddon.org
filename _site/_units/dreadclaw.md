    May transport one formation of infantry units (except Chaos Space Marine Bikes) and Chaos Dreadnoughts. The Dreadclaw does not scatter 2d6cm after being placed within 15cm of the drop zone co-ordinates recorded at the start of the game (see (Planetfall)[/tournament-pack/#planetfall]). Any troops carried in the Dreadclaw must disembark within 5cm of the Dreadclaw or within 5cm of another unit from the same formation that has already landed, so long as all units are placed within 15cm of the Dreadclaw. Dreadclaw models should be removed from the board once the formation they transport has disembarked.
