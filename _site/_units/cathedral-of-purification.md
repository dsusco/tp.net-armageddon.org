    May transport sixteen infantry units without _Jump Packs_ or _Mounted_. Four units being transported may shoot and use their firefight value in an assault or to lend support. Critical Hit Effect: The unit’s plasma reactor has been breached and D3 units of the player’s choice that are being transported are destroyed. Roll a D6 for each breach on the unit in the end phase of each turn. On a roll of 1 the unit is destroyed and all units within 5cm suffer a hit on a roll of 5+, and on a roll of 4–6 the breach has been repaired. Any breach not repaired causes one point of damage.
