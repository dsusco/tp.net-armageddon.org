    Armed with either an Energy Whip or a Plasma Cannon. May step over units and pieces of terrain that are lower than the unit’s knees and less than 2cm wide. Critical Hit Effect: The unit’s plasma reactor has been breached. Roll a D6 for each breach on the unit in the end phase of each turn. On a roll of 1 the unit is destroyed and all units within 5cm suffer a hit on a roll of 4+, and on a roll of 4–6 the breach has been repaired. Any breach not repaired causes one point of damage.
