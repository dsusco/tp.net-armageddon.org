    Counts as a Drop Pod for the purposes of being transported. May transport one formation of only the following units: Berzerkers, Chaos Dreadnoughts, Chaos Space Marine Chosen, Chaos Space Marines, Daemon Prince, Havocs, Noise Marines, Plague Marines, Thousand Sons. After the drop pod lands, its Deathwind attacks all enemy units within 15cm. Each enemy formation attacked receives a Blast marker for coming under fire, and an extra Blast marker for each casualty. Then any troops carried in the drop pod must disembark within 5cm of the drop pod or within 5cm of another unit from the same formation that has already landed, so long as all units are placed within 15cm of the drop pod. Drop pod models should be removed from the board once the formation they transport has disembarked.
